DONETSK, [Ukraine]Ukraine â The leader of separatist rebels in eastern [Ukraine]Ukraine was sworn in Tuesday as head of a self-declared secessionist territory following an election that was condemned by the [West]West as illegal and destabilizing.  [Alexander]Alexander Zakharchenko, 38, was inaugurated in a heavily guarded theater in the main stronghold of a rebel-controlled territory that separatists call the [Donetsk]Donetsk [People]People's [Republic]Republic.  Zakharchenko's election was largely a formality as no strong candidates opposed him, but the rebels say the vote gives them a mandate to pursue their secessionist goals.  [Ukraine]Ukraine and [Western]Western governments say [Sunday]Sunday's poll gravely endangered a much-violated cease-fire agreed upon in [September]September that envisioned local elections across the whole of the east but under [Ukrainian]Ukrainian law. [Russia]Russia, however, quickly lent its support to the vote.  [German Chancellor]German Chancellor [Angela Merkel]Angela Merkel, underlining her displeasure over what she said was [Russia]Russia's role in the conflict, said there is no reason yet to lift [European Union]European Union sanctions against [Moscow]Moscow. [Merkel]Merkel said she hopes for a diplomatic solution to [Ukraine]Ukraine's crisis but added the vote shows "how difficult it is even to maintain agreements that have been made, if we look at the illegal elections."  [Fighting]Fighting eased after the truce but eastern [Ukraine]Ukraine still sees almost daily clashes.  Zakharchenko took the stage after four sabre-wielding [Cossacks]Cossacks carried in the flag of the [Donetsk]Donetsk [People]People's [Republic]Republic. He swore the oath of [office]office with his hand on a [Bible]Bible to applause and whistles from [audience]audience members â many of them men in combat fatigues carrying automatic rifles.  [Lawmakers]Lawmakers from [Russia]Russia and [Georgia]Georgia's breakaway republic of [Abkhazia]Abkhazia, whose independence is recognized only by [Russia]Russia and three other countries, later mounted the stage. [Russian]Russian lawmaker Alexei Zhuravlev congratulated Zakharchenko, declaring: "[Russia]Russia doesn't give up on its own."  [Post]Post-inauguration entertainment included a traditional [Russian]Russian dance troupe led by a performer in a bear suit.  The inauguration coincided with [Russia]Russia's [National]National [Unity]Unity [Day]Day holiday, which saw rallies throughout the [country]country including one in [Moscow]Moscow that [police]police estimated at 75,000 participants.  The march in the center of the capital included banners reading "[Crimea]Crimea is ours" â the [Ukrainian]Ukrainian region annexed by [Russia]Russia in [March]March â and "Novorossiya -- we are with you." The separatist [Ukrainian]Ukrainian regions are widely referred to by that name, which means "New [Russia]Russia" and reflects the widespread opinion that eastern [Ukraine]Ukraine is historically and ethnically part of [Russia]Russia.

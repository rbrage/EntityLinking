[MEXICO]MEXICO [CITY]CITY â [Federal]Federal [police]police early Tuesday detained the former mayor of the southern [Mexican]Mexican city of Iguala and his wife, who are accused of ordering the [Sept.]Sept. 26 attacks on teachers' college students that left six dead and 43 still missing.  Jose [Luis]Luis Abarca and his wife, Maria de los [Angeles]Angeles Pineda, were arrested in [Mexico City]Mexico City without resisting, according to two [security]security officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.  The couple was in the custody of the [Attorney General]Attorney General's [Office]Office, where they were giving statements. At least 56 other [people]people have been arrested so far in the case, and the Iguala [police]police chief is still a fugitive.  The couple's detention could shed light on disappearances, which have prompted outraged demonstrations across the [country]country to demand the students be found. The case forced the resignation of the governor of [Guerrero]Guerrero state, where Iguala is located.  The students from a rural teachers college had gone to Iguala to canvass for donations and authorities say Abarca ordered the attack on them, believing the students were aiming to disrupt a speech by Pineda. They say the assault as carried out by [police]police working with the Guerreros Unidos drug cartel. [Authorities]Authorities say Pineda was a main operative in the cartel.  They also have said the drug gang essentially ran the town of Iguala, with Abarca receiving payments of 2 million to 3 million pesos ($150,000-$220,000) every few weeks, as a bribe and to pay off his corrupt [police]police force.  Guerreros Unidos have increasingly turned to the lucrative practice of growing opium poppies and sending opium paste to be refined for heroin destined for the [U.S.]U.S. market, according to a federal official.  The search for the students has taken authorities to the [hills]hills above Iguala, where 30 bodies have been found in [mass]mass graves but not identified so far as any of the students. Last week, the search turned to a gully near a trash dump in the neighboring city of Cocula, but still no remains have been identified.

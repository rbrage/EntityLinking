[MEXICO CITY] â [Federal] police early [Tuesday] detained the former mayor of the southern [Mexican] city of [Iguala] and his wife, who are accused of ordering the Sept. 26 attacks on teachers' college students that left six dead and 43 still missing.

[Jose Luis Abarca] and his wife, [Maria de los Angeles Pineda], were arrested in [Mexico City] without resisting, according to two security officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.

The couple was in the custody of the [Attorney General's Office], where they were giving statements. At least 56 other people have been arrested so far in the case, and the [Iguala] police chief is still a fugitive.

The couple's detention could shed light on disappearances, which have prompted outraged [demonstrations] across the country to demand the students be found. The case forced the resignation of the governor of [Guerrero] state, where Iguala is located.

The [students] from a [rural teachers college] had gone to [Iguala] to canvass for donations and authorities say [Abarca] ordered the attack on them, believing the students were aiming to disrupt a speech by [Pineda]. They say the assault as carried out by police working with the [Guerreros Unidos] [drug] [cartel]. Authorities say [Pineda] was a main operative in the [cartel].

They also have said the [drug] gang essentially ran the town of [Iguala], with [Abarca] receiving payments of 2 million to 3 million pesos ($150,000-$220,000) every few weeks, as a bribe and to pay off his [corrupt police] force.

[Guerreros Unidos] have increasingly turned to the lucrative practice of growing [opium] poppies and sending opium paste to be refined for [heroin] destined for the [U.S.] market, according to a federal official.

The search for the students has taken authorities to the hills above [Iguala], where 30 bodies have been found in mass graves but not identified so far as any of the [students]. Last week, the search turned to a gully near a trash dump in the neighboring city of [Cocula], but still no remains have been identified.

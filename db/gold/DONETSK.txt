[DONETSK], [Ukraine] â The leader of [separatist rebels] in eastern [Ukraine] was sworn in [Tuesday] as head of a self-declared [secessionist] territory following an election that was condemned by the West as illegal and destabilizing.

[Alexander Zakharchenko], 38, was inaugurated in a heavily guarded theater in the main stronghold of a rebel-controlled territory that separatists call the [Donetsk People's Republic].

[Zakharchenko's] election was largely a formality as no strong candidates opposed him, but the rebels say the vote gives them a mandate to pursue their secessionist goals.

[Ukraine] and Western governments say Sunday's poll gravely endangered a much-violated cease-fire agreed upon in [September] that envisioned local elections across the whole of the east but under [Ukrainian law]. [Russia], however, quickly lent its support to the vote.

[German Chancellor Angela Merkel], underlining her displeasure over what she said was [Russia's] role in the conflict, said there is no reason yet to lift [European Union] sanctions against [Moscow]. [Merkel] said she hopes for a diplomatic solution to [Ukraine's] crisis but added the vote shows "how difficult it is even to maintain agreements that have been made, if we look at the illegal [elections]."

Fighting eased after the truce but eastern [Ukraine] still sees almost daily clashes.

[Zakharchenko] took the stage after four [sabre-wielding Cossacks] carried in the flag of the [Donetsk People's Republic]. He swore the oath of office with his hand on a [Bible] to applause and whistles from audience members â many of them men in combat fatigues carrying automatic rifles.

[Lawmakers] from [Russia] and [Georgia's] breakaway republic of [Abkhazia], whose independence is recognized only by [Russia] and three other countries, later mounted the stage. [Russian] lawmaker [Alexei Zhuravlev] congratulated [Zakharchenko], declaring: "[Russia] doesn't give up on its own."

[Post-inauguration] entertainment included a traditional [Russian] dance troupe led by a performer in a bear suit.

The inauguration coincided with [Russia's National Unity Day] holiday, which saw rallies throughout the country including one in [Moscow] that police estimated at 75,000 participants.

The march in the center of the capital included banners reading "Crimea is ours" â the [Ukrainian] region annexed by [Russia] in March â and "[Novorossiya] -- we are with you." The [separatis]t [Ukrainian] regions are widely referred to by that name, which means "New [Russia]" and reflects the widespread opinion that eastern [Ukraine] is historically and ethnically part of [Russia].

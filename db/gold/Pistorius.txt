Starting a new phase in a case that captivated a global audience, [South African] state [prosecutors] began legal proceedings on [Tuesday] to appeal the conviction and sentence handed down to the track star [Oscar Pistorius] last month for killing his girlfriend.

[Mr. Pistorius] was acquitted of murder charges but was convicted of a lesser charge of [culpable homicide], equivalent to [manslaughter], and sentenced to five years in prison. [South African law] calls for him to serve at least 10 months of the sentence in prison before he can be released to house arrest.

During his seven-month trial, the [athlete], 27, a double amputee since infancy, said he was not guilty of murder but admitted to killing his girlfriend, [Reeva Steenkamp], a 29-year-old law graduate and model. He said he believed an intruder had entered his home when he fired four rounds through a locked toilet cubicle door on Feb. 14, 2013.

In a statement that was also posted on [Twitter], [Nathi Mncube], a spokesman for the [National Prosecuting Authority], said on [Tuesday] that the organization had filed âapplication for leave to appeal [Oscar Pistorius] judgment and sentence.â

It was not clear when the case would be heard or whether permission to appeal would be granted.

âThe appeal on conviction is based on the question of law,â [Mr. Mncube] said. The prosecution contends that while [Mr. Pistorius] had been convicted of a negligent killing, [Judge] [Thokozile Matilda Masipa] should have found him guilty of murder.

The argument, echoed by some legal experts, is that under a principle known as dolus eventualis, [Mr. Pistorius] should have been held accountable for the foreseeable consequences of his actions. The charge is less serious than premeditated murder but could carry a term of 15 years.

[Mr. Pistorius] is being held in the hospital wing of the [Kgosi Mampuru II prison], formerly known as [Pretoria Central], in [Pretoria], the [South African capital].

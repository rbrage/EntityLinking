It was not clear when the case would be heard or whether permission to appeal would be granted.

âThe appeal on conviction is based on the [Question of law]question of law,â Mr. Mncube said. The prosecution contends that while Mr. Pistorius had been convicted of a [Negligence]negligent killing, [Judge]Judge Thokozile Matilda Masipa should have found him guilty of murder.

The charge is less serious than [Premeditated murder]premeditated murder but could carry a term of 15 years.

Mr. Pistorius is being held in the [Hospital]hospital wing of the Kgosi Mampuru II prison, formerly known as Pretoria [Central America]Central, in Pretoria, the South African [Capital (economics)]capital.

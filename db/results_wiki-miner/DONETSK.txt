DONETSK, [Ukraine]Ukraine â The leader of [Separatism]separatist [Rebellion]rebels in [East Ukraine]eastern Ukraine was sworn in [October 10]Tuesday as head of a self-declared [Secession]secessionist [Territory (country subdivision)]territory following an [Election]election that was condemned by the [Western world]West as [Law]illegal and destabilizing.

[Alexander the Great]Alexander Zakharchenko, 38, was inaugurated in a heavily guarded [Theatre]theater in the main [Stronghold]stronghold of a rebel-controlled territory that separatists call the [Donetsk]Donetsk [People's Republic of China]People's [Republic]Republic.

Zakharchenko's election was largely a formality as no strong candidates opposed him, but the rebels say the vote gives them a [Mandate (international law)]mandate to pursue their secessionist goals.

Ukraine and Western governments say [Sunday]Sunday's [Opinion poll]poll gravely [Endangered species]endangered a much-violated [Ceasefire]cease-fire agreed upon in September that envisioned local elections across the whole of the east but under [Law of Ukraine]Ukrainian law. [Russia]Russia, however, quickly lent its support to the vote.

[German language]German [Chancellor]Chancellor Angela Merkel, [Underline]underlining her displeasure over what she said was Russia's role in the [War]conflict, said there is no [Reason]reason yet to [Elevator]lift [European Union]European [Union (American Civil War)]Union [International sanctions]sanctions against [Moscow]Moscow. Merkel said she hopes for a [Diplomacy]diplomatic [Solution]solution to Ukraine's crisis but added the vote shows "how difficult it is even to maintain agreements that have been made, if we look at the illegal elections."

Fighting eased after the truce but eastern Ukraine still sees almost daily clashes.

Zakharchenko took the stage after four [Sabre]sabre-wielding [Cossacks]Cossacks carried in the [Flag]flag of the Donetsk People's Republic. He swore the [Oath]oath of office with his hand on a [Bible]Bible to [Applause]applause and [Whistles]whistles from [Audience]audience members â many of them men in [Combat]combat [Battledress]fatigues carrying [Automatic rifle]automatic [Rifle]rifles.

[Legislator]Lawmakers from Russia and [Georgia (country)]Georgia's [Schism (religion)]breakaway republic of [Abkhazia]Abkhazia, whose [Independence]independence is [Diplomatic recognition]recognized only by Russia and three other [Country]countries, later mounted the stage. [Russian language]Russian lawmaker [Alexis of Russia]Alexei Zhuravlev congratulated Zakharchenko, declaring: "Russia doesn't give up on its own."

Post-[Inauguration]inauguration [Entertainment]entertainment included a traditional Russian [Dance]dance [Troupe]troupe led by a [Performing arts]performer in a [Bear]bear [Lawsuit]suit.

The inauguration coincided with Russia's [National Unity (Peru)]National [Unity Day (Russia)]Unity Day [Holiday]holiday, which saw [Demonstration (people)]rallies throughout the country including one in Moscow that [Police]police estimated at 75,000 participants.

The [March (territory)]march in the center of the [Capital city]capital included [Colours, standards and guidons]banners [Reading (process)]reading "[Crimea]Crimea is ours" â the Ukrainian [Region]region [Annexation]annexed by Russia in March â and "[Novorossiya]Novorossiya -- we are with you." The separatist [Administrative divisions of Ukraine]Ukrainian regions are widely referred to by that name, which means "New Russia" and reflects the widespread opinion that eastern Ukraine is historically and [Ethnic group]ethnically part of Russia.

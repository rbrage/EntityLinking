JERUSALEM — Residents jokingly refer to “Lower Ramat Shlomo”: In the parking area beneath [Apartment]apartments, instead of cars, wood-veneer doors mark homes fashioned illegally to accommodate a bursting population.  [Middle East]Elsewhere in the [Haredi Judaism]ultra-[Orthodox Judaism]Orthodox [Judaism]Jewish [Neighbourhood]neighborhood of [Byzantine Empire]East [Jerusalem]Jerusalem, courtyards and porches are enclosed by wood, glass, even burlap — every available space, it seems, transformed into makeshift shacks by a community whose growth has been stymied by the fraught [Politics]politics of this contested [City]city.   “It’s not too far from Delhi or [Mumbai]Bombay,” [Ezra]Ezra Berger, the head of Ramat Shlomo’s Community Council, said with admitted exaggeration as he showed sidewalks dotted with racks of drying laundry.   “It’s like a ticking time [Bomb]bomb in the neighborhood — it’s a [Social]social bomb, and it’s also a [Health care]health bomb.   "Built two decades ago on land captured from [Jordan]Jordan by [Israel]Israel in the [1967]1967 [World War II]war, [Ramat Shlomo]Ramat Shlomo has become a prime [Symbol]symbol of Israel’s [2006 Lebanon War]conflict with the [Palestinian people]Palestinians and, especially, its [Diplomacy]diplomatic confrontations with [Washington, D.C.]Washington and the rest of the world.   On Monday, after an [Israelis]Israeli committee approved about 500 new apartments in Ramat Shlomo, the [Barack Obama]Obama administration condemned the measure — for at least the sixth time since expansion plans were unveiled during a [2010]2010 visit to Jerusalem by [Vice President of the United States]Vice [President of the United States]President Joseph [Republican Party (United States)]R.   [Joe Biden]Biden Jr.   “It would be unfortunate at this sensitive time that after the unequivocal and unanimous position last week of the [United States]United States and others in the [International law]international community opposing construction in East Jerusalem, Israeli authorities are actively seeking to move these plans forward,” said Edgar Vasquez, a [United States Department of State]State Department spokesman.   “We continue to engage at the highest levels with the [Politics of Israel]Israeli [Government]government to make our position absolutely clear that we view [Israeli settlement]settlement activity as illegitimate and that we unequivocally oppose [Unilateralism]unilateral steps that prejudge the future of Jerusalem.  ”But for all the international outrage that Ramat Shlomo has engendered, not a single new home has been built there in a [1980s]decade.  Instead, the neighborhood is a case study of stalemate amid the broader struggle over the [Positions on Jerusalem]fate of Jerusalem, which both Israelis and Palestinians claim as their [Capital city]capital and ancestral heart. Palestinians building homes in East Jerusalem.  The Israeli authorities said they would fast-track plans for 1,060 new apartments in the area. [Benjamin Netanyahu]Netanyahu Expedites Plan for More Than 1,000 New Apartments in East Jerusalem OCT.  27, 2014 The new plans include 600 units in Ramat Shlomo. In Blow to [Nobel Peace Prize]Peace Effort, Israel Publishes Plans for New Housing in Settlements JAN.  10, 2014 As Biden Visits, Israel Unveils Plan for New Settlements MARCH 9, 2010Critics of Israeli settlement policy see every [Muslim conquests]push forward as a provocation that further hampers the prospects for a [Two-state solution]two-[Sovereign state]state solution.  Some also see Ramat Shlomo as a pawn in a political game, in which [Prime minister]Prime [Diplomatic rank]Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel announces building plans both as retaliation when he feels that Israel has been slighted and as a salve to pro-settlement forces.  But they say he may be delaying the actual construction in order to contain the wrath of the United States, [United Nations]United Nations and [European Union]European Union. “The Israeli government is in some sort of a bind — it’s not able to change its policy on building, and it’s also not able to follow through,” said Aviv Tatarsky, a researcher at Ir Amim, an [Organization]organization that opposes settlement expansion.  “Building is happening in some places, but declarations are happening much more. ”Continue reading the main story Ramat Shlomo — one of a dozen large Jewish neighborhoods built on East Jerusalem land whose [Annexation]annexation by Israel has never been internationally [International recognition of Kosovo]recognized — was an empty hilltop before 1967, according to [History]historical photos.  Its 173 [Acre]acres near Jerusalem’s northern [Border]boundary were [Eminent domain]expropriated from the adjacent Palestinian community of [Shuafat]Shuafat — some residents still call it Shuafat Ridge.  Mr.  Netanyahu and his [Allies of World War II]allies maintain that building anywhere in Jerusalem is an Israeli right.  They point out that the parameters outlined in [2000]2000 by [Bill Clinton]President Bill Clinton for a two-state solution, as well as two-state maps drawn since, presume that Ramat Shlomo and the other Jewish areas in Jerusalem would remain [Israelites]part of Israel, while Shuafat and other [Arab people]Arab areas would be part of a [Proposals for a Palestinian state]future [Palestine]Palestine.  Unlike the even more contentious purchasing of properties by [Jews]Jews inside Palestinian neighborhoods like [Silwan]Silwan, some argue, expanding Ramat Shlomo hardly changes the reality on the ground.  But Shuafat residents point out that the whole neighborhood is on land that once belonged to their families.  Israel recently took 20 more acres to build a new road in the area, and Palestinians fear that the road will make it more difficult for them to access their [Olive]olive trees.  They, too, are constructing [Illegal immigration]illegal dwellings to absorb growth, since only a handful of building permits have been granted in recent years.  “It’s clear that if you expand settlements, that means you reduce space for the Palestinian neighborhoods,” said Sami Ershid, a [Lawyer]lawyer who represented 38 Shuafat families opposing the Ramat Shlomo expansion at a 2012 hearing.  “You cannot [International trade]import land and put it on the ground. ” Both Palestinians and Israelis place a premium on living close to where they were born, complicating the challenge of providing affordable housing in Jerusalem’s crowded precincts.  When 2,100 housing units were built in Ramat Shlomo in the [1990s]1990s by seven [Nonprofit organization]nonprofit groups serving large, poor Orthodox families, there was little [Protest]public outcry.  Several residents said in recent interviews that they did not realize that their new homes were over the [Green Line (Israel)]Green Line, the pre-1967 boundary between [Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty]Israel and Jordan.  Most said they moved for [Economy]economic, not [Ideology]ideological, reasons.  Yaakov and Shayny Pinsky said they paid $150,000 for a four-bedroom flat with a large yard, where they raised 12 children (“Lots of bunk beds,” Mr.  Pinsky explained).  A woman examining an apartment offered for rent last week in Ramat Shlomo.  The flat had been [Conversion to Judaism]converted from a parking area in the overcrowded neighborhood in East Jerusalem.  Credit Uriel [Sinai Peninsula]Sinai for [The New York Times]The [New York]New York Times “We were in Jerusalem,” Mrs.  Pinsky said.  “We didn’t think there was anything wrong with it. ” Named for [Rabbi]Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, a [Yeshiva]yeshiva chief beloved across Orthodox [Sect]sects who died in [1995]1995, the neighborhood now has 42 large [Synagogue]synagogues, according to Mr.  Berger, including a red brick replica of 770 [Eastern Europe]Eastern Parkway, the [Brooklyn]Brooklyn headquarters of the [Chabad]Chabad-Lubavitch [Social movement]movement.  There is a small post office, but no [Bank]bank.  There are also remnants of a quarry where [Monarch]King Herod may have taken stones for the [Second Temple]Second [Temple in Jerusalem]Temple more than 2,000 years ago.  Ramat Shlomo’s official population in 2012 was 17,200, though Mr.  Berger puts it at 23,000.  There are 2,320 [Law]legal housing units, averaging about 1,000 square feet.  Hundreds of illegal ones, most of them 200 square feet with [Piracy]pirated electricity and water, rent for $1,000 a month.

Building in Jerusalem is a multistep process that can take more than two years under the simplest circumstances.  When Israel’s [Interior ministry]interior ministry announced plans for 1,600 new units to be built along Ramat Shlomo’s west and south during Mr.  Biden’s visit in March 2010, the [Vice president]vice [President]president called it “precisely the kind of step that undermines the trust we need right now. ” In August 2011, the ministry gave the units “final approval,” and a State Department spokeswoman said “unilateral action of this kind works against our efforts to get folks back to the table. ” The so-called “Biden units,” reduced to 1,500, were approved again in December 2012 as part of Israel’s response to the [United Nations General Assembly]United Nations [General officer]General Assembly vote granting Palestine status as an [Member of the European Parliament]observer state.  And they were approved again in October 2013, after Palestinians who had served long terms in [Palestinian prisoners in Israel]Israeli [Prison]prisons were released amid American-brokered [Direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians (2010-2011)]peace talks.  Tenders for 600 of the units were published in January, apparently as part of Mr.  Netanyahu’s effort to offset domestic political fallout from another [Prisoner of war]prisoner release.  In June, yet another announcement was made about moving forward with the project, in retaliation for the Palestinians forming a [Republic of China]new government based on a reconciliation pact with the [Militant]militant [Islamism]Islamist [Hamas]Hamas movement.  Then last week, Mr.  Netanyahu revived a plan that both Mr.  Berger and Ir Amim say has been dormant since [2006]2006, for about 600 units to be built on private land at the neighborhood’s northern tip, which the committee approved Monday with a reduction of about 100 units.  For the Pinskys, whose eight married children are scattered around Jerusalem and beyond, this is a dream they are not counting on coming true.  “My kids would love to have a project that they could live closer to home,” Mr.  Pinsky said.  “One day it’s happening and it’s electrifying, the next day there’s a blackout. ” For Mohsen Abu Khdeir, a Shuafat chiropractor, it is a nightmare.  “Families are going to stand in front of the [Bulldozer]bulldozers,” he warned.

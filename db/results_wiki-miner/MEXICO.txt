[Mexico]MEXICO [CITY-TV]CITY â [Federal police]Federal [Police]police early Tuesday detained the former [Mayor]mayor of the [Southern United States]southern Mexican [City]city of [Iguala]Iguala and his wife, who are accused of ordering the Sept. 26 attacks on [Normal school]teachers' [College]college students that left six dead and 43 still missing.

Jose Luis Abarca and his wife, Maria de los Angeles [Pineda, Florida]Pineda, were arrested in [Mexico City]Mexico City without resisting, according to two [Security]security officials, who spoke on condition of [Anonymity]anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the [Freedom of the press]press.

The couple was in the [Child custody]custody of the [Attorney General of Mexico]Attorney [General officer]General's Office, where they were giving statements. At least 56 other people have been arrested so far in the case, and the Iguala [Chief of police]police [Tribal chief]chief is still a [Fugitive]fugitive.

The couple's [Detention (imprisonment)]detention could [Shed]shed [Light]light on [Forced disappearance]disappearances, which have prompted outraged [Demonstration (people)]demonstrations across the [Country music]country to [Demand (economics)]demand the students be found. The case forced the [Resignation]resignation of the [Governor of Guerrero]governor of [Guerrero]Guerrero [U.S. state]state, where Iguala is located.

The students from a [Rural area]rural teachers college had gone to Iguala to [Canvassing]canvass for [Donation]donations and authorities say Abarca ordered the attack on them, believing the students were aiming to disrupt a [Freedom of speech]speech by Pineda. They say the [Assault]assault as carried out by police working with the [Guerreros]Guerreros Unidos [Drug cartel]drug [Cartel]cartel. Authorities say Pineda was a main operative in the cartel.

They also have said the drug [Gang]gang essentially ran the [Town]town of Iguala, with Abarca receiving payments of 2 million to 3 million [Mexican peso]pesos ($150,000-$220,000) every few weeks, as a [Bribery]bribe and to pay off his [Police corruption]corrupt police [Force]force.

Guerreros Unidos have increasingly turned to the lucrative practice of growing [Opium poppy]opium poppies and sending opium [Adhesive]paste to be refined for [Heroin]heroin destined for the [United States]U.S. [Market]market, according to a federal official.

The search for the students has taken authorities to the [Hill]hills above Iguala, where 30 bodies have been found in [Mass]mass [Grave]graves but not identified so far as any of the students. Last week, the search turned to a [Gully]gully near a [Waste]trash [Landfill]dump in the neighboring city of [Cocula, Jalisco]Cocula, but still no remains have been identified.

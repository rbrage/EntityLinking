BAIDOA, [Somalia]Somalia — [Abu Bakar Bashir]Bashir was a true believer, a [Infantry]foot [Soldier]soldier who recently quit after seeing too many innocents [Murder]slaughtered.

Ahmed [Desertion]deserted the [Al-Shabaab]Shabab because he wanted a real [Family (biology)]family, not just a bunch of heavily armed, sociopathic [Militant]militants who called themselves a “family,” he said.

And young Nurta was a slender [Assassination]assassin, with a bright [Purple]purple [Scarf]scarf and wide, seemingly innocent eyes.

“There is no life with them,” said Nurta, who like other Shabab [Defection]defectors requested that her last name not be used for [Fear]fear of [Reprisal]reprisals.

Even before its leader was cut down in an [United States]American [Airstrike]airstrike in September, the Shabab [Paramilitary]militant group in Somalia, once one of Al Qaeda’s most powerful franchises, began unraveling. In the past few months, the group has been shedding [British Overseas Territories]territory — and [Fighter aircraft]fighters.

Dozens of defectors have been staying in a drab, one-story, heavily guarded [Concrete]concrete-block building in [Baidoa]Baidoa, a scruffy town in central Somalia.

The picture they [Paint]paint — in their accounts, and in their mere presence at a [Halfway house]halfway house off the battlefield — is one of the Shabab in decline, without a [Charismatic Movement]charismatic leader, its ranks thinning, a once powerful [Organization]organization now partly defanged, though still dangerous.

In early October, with [African Union]African Union [Peacekeeping]peacekeepers bearing down on them, Shabab fighters slunk away from one of the last [Military strategy]strategically important [City]cities the group controlled in Somalia, [Barawa]Barawe, an old [Port]port town on the threadbare [South India]southern [Coast]coast. Residents said a [Column]column of Shabab [Battle]battle wagons chugged off into the [Desert]desert, splitting up into smaller groups that then [Forced disappearance]disappeared in different directions.

Just a few years ago, the Shabab held much of southern Somalia in its brutal thrall. Shabab fighters chopped off heads, [Starvation]starved children, snatched up [Adolescence]adolescent brides and [Stoning]stoned to [Death]death those girls who refused.

Until the advent of the [Islamic state]Islamic State, or ISIS, in [Iraq]Iraq and [Syria]Syria, the Shabab controlled more territory than any other Qaeda subgroup, bringing in millions of [United States dollar]dollars by running ports and imposing [Tax]taxes, which were used to bankroll [September 11 attacks]terrorist attacks across the [Region]region.

The Shabab were seen as a cause — and effect — of Somalia’s years of [Civil disorder]chaos and one of the gravest threats to American interests in [Africa]Africa. They were also considered a direct threat to the [Mainland China]mainland United States. Several of their fighters, including some of the toughest, have been [Citizenship in the United States]American [Citizenship]citizens, able to fight in Somalia one day and potentially return to the United States the next.

But African Union peacekeepers, including [Uganda]Ugandans and [People of Ethiopia]Ethiopians, have dislodged Shabab fighters from all [Major]major towns in southern Somalia. The [Somali people]Somali [Population]population has decidedly turned against the Shabab.

In killing the Shabab’s leader, [Moktar Ali Zubeyr]Ahmed Abdi Godane, the United States showed that after years of botched operations, it had finally cracked the group’s code, able to determine the exact location of the top militant in the [Country music]country and kill him with minimal [Collateral (finance)]collateral damage.

But it also showed the deepening fractures in the Shabab’s organization: Analysts say the only way the Americans could have known where Mr. Godane was lurking was if someone in his inner [Circle]circle had sold him out.

Since Mr. Godane’s replacement is a little-known fighter without much of a following, several Shabab defectors said that what little allure the group enjoyed was virtually gone. Some Shabab fighters have [Human migration]migrated north to the [Galgala]Galgala Mountains of [Puntland]Puntland, where they occasionally clash with local forces. [Western world]Western [Intelligence]intelligence officials estimate there are just a few thousand hardened Shabab fighters left.

Still, the Shabab might be like a [Poison]poison: most dangerous when concentrated.

“The organization, in terms of its capacity, is still intact,” warned Afyare A. Elmi, a Somali [Professor]professor at [Qatar University]Qatar University.

He predicts that the militant group will continue to shed territory but “will keep up its [Guerrilla warfare]guerrilla attacks and [Explosion]explosions.” Other analysts said the Shabab is actually getting more proficient in its assassinations, recently gunning down several Somali [Politician]politicians.

As the Shabab showed [2005]last year, all it needs is a few die-hard followers to carry out deadly attacks. Four Shabab [Crime]gunmen massacred dozens of [Civilian]civilians in a [Shopping mall]mall attack in [Nairobi]Nairobi, [Kenya]Kenya, which still has the population there on edge.

At the “transition facility,” as the [Politics of Somalia]Somali [Government]government calls the drab Shabab halfway house in Baidoa, elders are pushing computer skills, [Carpentry]carpentry and [Welding]welding. The easiest way to de-radicalize former [Mujahideen]jihadists, the [Theory]theory goes, is to give them jobs.

All of the former fighters said they felt [Hunting]hunted. Even in Baidoa, Shabab [Espionage]agents continue to slip in and out undetected.

Ahmed, 26, joined the Shabab [1990]four years ago because of the promises the group made.

“I didn’t have a job,” he said. “They told me you will get a lot of [Money]money, a [Bungalow]bungalow and go to [Paradise]paradise.”

After fighting for the Shabab for three years, though, Ahmed never got his bungalow.

“No life, no family, no future,” he shook his head.

Noor, 29, another recent defector, was a member of a rival group when he was captured and forced to fight for the Shabab. He said they “conveyed the wrong message about Islam.”

“They placed heavy taxes on people,” he said. When he tried to argue, Shabab members [Assault]beat him.

When Bashir, [24 (TV series)]24, first joined the Shabab, he believed in their ideas. He believed in [Sacred]holy [War]war, he believed in a new [Islamism]Islamist Somalia, he believed in a rigid and decisive interpretation of [Sharia]Islamic [Law]law more than a thousand years old.

But when Mr. Godane took over the Shabab, around [2008]2008, Bashir was no longer sure what he believed in.

Mr. Godane “allowed for the killing of innocent people. And I think he worked for elements from other [Country]countries, not for Somalia.”

“I am happy to hear he is dead,” Bashir said.

So is Nurta, the young [Female]female assassin. Her involvement with the Shabab was never a [Matter]matter of choice. She was [Kidnapping]kidnapped, she said, by foreign fighters, [White people]white men, who snatched her from her [School]school when she was 16. She was the perfect terrorist: a young woman who few might [Suspect]suspect of being a killer.

“I was trained to [Shooting]shoot targets in [State school]public areas, how to jump over buildings and target watch towers,” she said.

Nurta said she soon became an [Expert]expert in the tools of death: [AK-47]AK-47s, [Sniper]sniper [Rifle]rifles, [Bomb]bombs, [Handgun]pistols of various make.

She said she was dispatched to the Kenyan coast in [2011]2011 to help kidnap two [Alien (law)]foreigners, crimes that deeply hurt the country’s [Tourism]tourism [Industry]industry and helped [Lead]lead Kenya to later send troops into Somalia.

But at one point, she said, enough was enough. Nurta grew sick of seeing her colleagues’ [Cavalry]cavalier disregard for [Human]human life.

Even when the Shabab’s own [Star]star fighters were wounded in battle, she said, “they didn’t care and [Infanticide]left them to die.”

After defecting, Nurta went [Resistance movement]underground. But the Shabab were determined to find her. She knew too much.

Earlier this year, while she was in the [Market]market in Baidoa, she saw a Shabab assassin whom she knew. Their eyes locked. She tried to run as he pulled the pin on his [Grenade]grenade. The explosion floored her. [Shrapnel shell]Shrapnel sliced into her face. She survived, but shortly after that, the Shabab murdered her brother.

“I ask [God]God to forgive me,” she said, the [Tears]tears running down her scarred cheek.

In late September, right before the Shabab pulled out of Barawe, they marched a young woman into the middle of an open field. They buried her in the [Sand]sand up to her neck. They smashed her brains with [Rock (geology)]rocks.

They accused the woman of [Adultery]adultery, and the grisly [Capital punishment]execution seemed intended to send a simple but ineluctable message: The group is not done yet.

An Earth Day Message from Jim Atchison, President of SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment
"Our parks celebrate Earth Day every day. SeaWorld and Busch Gardens care for more than 60,000 animals, including 200 endangered and threatened species. At the heart of our commitment to these animals is a passion for celebrating and strengthening the human/animal connection. You will see this passion in the stories below, from a new Shamu show that inspires conservation to kids creating eco-projects. This Earth Day I hope you find your own passion and make a difference in preserving the world we share."

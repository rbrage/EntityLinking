Mandela Grave Battle Continues 
Court proceedings in the Mandela graves case resumed in the Eastern Cape High Court in Mthatha on Wednesday.

Former president Nelson Mandela's eldest daughter Makaziwe, her nephew Ndaba and niece Ndileka were in court to observe proceedings.
Makaziwe and more than a dozen family members were last week granted an order compelling Madiba's grandson Mandla Mandela, who is chief of Mvezo, to return the remains of his dad, aunt, and uncle.
Mandla Mandela exhumed the graves and moved them from Qunu to Mvezo in 2011.
He did so without the knowledge or consent of his relatives.
The chief on Wednesday lodged opposing papers, asking the court to set aside its order.
The graves are those of Mandela's eldest son, Mandla Mandela's father, Makgatho Mandela, who died in 2005; Mandela's first daughter Makaziwe, who died as an infant in 1948; and Mandela's second son Madiba Thembekile, who died in a car accident in 1969.

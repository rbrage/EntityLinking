'BioShock Infinite' scoops four at Game Critics Awards 
BioShock Infinite (due mid-2012) took four wins from the Game Critics Awards' Best of E3 2011, including Best of Show, while Battlefield 3, Sound Shapes, and Skyrim also made a strong impression.

BioShock Infinite also collected wins for Best Original Game, Best PC Game, and Best Action/Adventure.
Battlefield 3, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Sound Shapes all came out of the contest with two awards each.
Battlefield 3(October 25) took Best Action Game and Best Online Multiplayer ahead of both Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3(November 8) and Gears of War 3(September 20).
Skyrim(November 11) was awarded Best Console Game and Best Role Playing Game, while the PlayStation Vita title Sound Shapes(TBA) won in the Best Handheld Game and Best Social/Casual categories.
Two of the Xbox 360's Summer of Arcade promotional downloads emerged with a trophy to show for their achievements.
Bastion(July 20), whose crew have worked on the Command & Conquer and Call of Duty series, was deemed Best Downloadable; From Dust(July 27), marking eagerly anticipated return of industry vet Eric Chahi, was given the Best Strategy award.
FIFA 12(September 27) was Best Sport Game, Forza 4(October 11) Best Racing Game, Street Fighter X Tekken(early 2012) Best Fighting Game, and The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword(late 2011) Best Motion Simulation Game -- a reassurance given a shakey (if not charming) stage demo at E3 2010.
Best Hardware went to the PlayStation Vita, expected to start a phased launch late in 2011.
Its handheld rival, the Nintendo 3DS, won both Best Hardware and Best of Show in the 2010 Game Critics Awards.

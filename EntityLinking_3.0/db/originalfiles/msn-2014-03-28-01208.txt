INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) ' It's a record to top all records.
The Inglewood Forum, for years a popular rock concert venue, has placed the world's largest vinyl record on its roof for the benefit of the 1,700 flights landing at nearby Los Angeles International Airport each day. And it actually spins.
So what record-breaking record is it? The 1976 multi-platinum LP "Hotel California" by the Eagles, who kick off the reopening of the refurbished Forum next Wednesday with a series of six concerts through the end of the month.
Now for more spin from the Forum PR department: The 407-foot diameter disc rotates at 17 mph and was constructed by a crew of more than 75 workers. The Forum's $100 million renovation will make it the largest indoor entertainment venue in the country.

How It Works
An IP address is an Internet Protocol address, which is what enables you to do things like sending a message in a chat program to another computer, and out of all the millions of computers in the world, it arrives at the correct one. The numerical sequence serves as an identifier for an Internet server. Every server has its own unique address. However, since it is used to identify all the different computers and websites on the Internet, it could be used to track your communications with all websites or programs that connect to the Internet. This is known as Direct Internet Connection. Mask My IP can connect to our servers and gets the most stable, fresh and fast working IP location called proxy. Grossly oversimplified, a proxy is a remote machine which you connect through to the Net, which forwards your IP traffic, and which you then appear to be originating from. When you contact a Web site via an anonymous proxy, it's the proxy's IP which shows in their logs. When running Mask My IP on your computer, it will modify your Internet Connection Settings, telling your computer to make connections through a Fake IP Relay provided by Mask My IP instead of through Direct Internet Connection. It works with Internet Explorer, FireFox, Opera, Maxthon, MyIE browsers and is compatible with all types of routers, firewalls, home networks, wireless networks and any other kind of Internet. All websites visited or E-mails sent using these browsers will show you are connecting from one of our fake IP addresses.

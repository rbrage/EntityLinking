Grit Watch: Tell us what conditions are like across Cumbria

A new fleet of gritters and a mountain of grit. Cumbria County Council says it is ready for this winter's icy blast.
The gritters can be fitted with snow ploughs and two new four wheel drive trucks - with snow blowers - are on hand to tackle some of the county's highest roads.
The county council says it cannot grit every road so it concentrates on a "core network of priority routes".
"First priority routes are gritted within three hours and second priority within five," a spokesman said.
"Minor roads are only gritted once these priority routes are done."
Use this page to let us know if the roads in your area are not being gritted, your salt bin is empty - or if people are hard at work keeping routes safe and open.
You can also use it to tell us what the conditions are like where you are.
Don't forget to send pictures if you spot empty salt bins or sheet ice on untreated roads. You can email us at news.carlisle@cngroup.co.uk

Grannies fight back against rapists 

An elderly woman is teaching her peers how to combat a spate of rape attacks targeting elderly women in Kenya's slums.
In the sludge-covered alleyways of the Korogocho slum, 50 women, many of them grandmothers, have enrolled in twice-a-week self-defence classes at a run-down community centre.
The women have enlisted the help of 70-year-old Mary Wangui and 20-something fellow instructor Sheila Kariuki because they say police rarely patrol the dark paths that wind through the maze of iron-roofed shanties.
When suspected rapists are reported to the police, they often bribe their way to freedom, the women claim. One Nairobi hospital treated 437 rape victims over 60 last year.
At the Korogocho community hall, elderly women clad in headscarves, long skirts and petticoats pounded punchbags with the heels of their bare feet.
"No, no, no!" screamed Ms Wangui as she forced Ms Kariuki backwards with a series of open-palm blows on a hitting pad, cheered by a group of around 30 women aged between 50 and 80.
"When we hit the pad with an open palm we are training to target the nose, the solar plexus or the groin to hurt an attacker so that it can give you a chance to escape. Shouting 'no' repetitively is meant to draw the attention of people so that they can assist you," said Ms Wangui, who has been training for almost two years.
"Don't feel any mercy. Was he coming to read the Bible with you?" Ms Kariuki asks the women.
One of the causes of elderly rape is a belief by criminals that sex with an elderly women can cure them of Aids. Others think raping an elderly woman will cleanse their sins after committing crimes, Ms Kariuki said.
Ten elderly women have been raped and killed in Korogocho over the last two years, but no suspects have been arrested. Many other rapes are believed to have taken place but not reported.

S R Nathan launches latest memoir

SINGAPORE: Former President S R Nathan has officially launched his latest memoir, "50 Stories from My Life".
The stories are from Mr Nathan's autobiography. He said he picked them to make a shorter and more readable book that would appeal to people of all ages, especially the young.
Mr Nathan said these stories span more than 80 years of personal experiences -- as a witness to the development of Singapore from his childhood before World War II, to the country's independence and nationhood.
Mr Nathan said he hopes to give a flavour of daily life in those years and how his generation coped with the challenges, even as the younger generation of Singaporeans today face very different challenges.
He said: "The younger generation of Singaporeans today face daunting challenges -- very different from those of half a century ago. The world has changed. The challenges that they face are in many ways hard to overcome. But the personal qualities necessary for a satisfying life and career, and a sense of personal development have not changed at all.
"In fact, life is for them, tougher -- with so many temptations strewn in their way... That is why, looking back, I think there are some useful lessons to be learned from my experiences over the years." - CNA/ac

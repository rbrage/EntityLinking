Pregnant Reese Witherspoon Wears Tight Shirt, Jeans in DC 

Have bump, will travel!
Third-time mom-to-be Reese Witherspoon touched down in Washington, DC on Friday. The This Means War actress, 36, held hands with husband Jim Toth and sported adorably casual travel gear: jeans, black Converse Chuck Taylor sneaks, baseball cap, sunglasses and a tight black shirt that displayed her expanding baby bump.

Witherspoon and CAA agent Toth, 41, are just two of the A-listers in the nation's capitol for the weekend. This Saturday, they'll hobknob with President Barack Obama and a room full of government officials and political reporters for the annual, increasingly star-studded White House Correspondents' Dinner.

Among the A-listers joining Witherspoon and Toth? George Clooney, Robert Pattinson, Viola Davis, Charlize Theron, Eva Longoria, Daniel Day-Lewis, pregnant Anna Paquin and husband Stephen Moyer, Claire Danes, Zooey Deschanel, Dakota Fanning, Josh Hutcherson, Lindsay Lohan -- and even Uggie, the beloved dog from The Artist. The bash will be the first formal event Witherspoon has attended since Us Weekly broke news of her third pregnancy over a month ago.

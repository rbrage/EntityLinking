A MAN urinated on his wife and told her to stand  in a bath tub until  her clothes dried in one of the most shocking incidents of  domestic  abuse in Zimbabwe.
Ishmuel Musoni, 48, also made his wife and two  children aged 10 and  15 sleep in the open after locking them out of their Greendale home -  because she had refused to go and buy him beer.
On Monday, Musoni admitted assault and indecent  exposure after the  Harare Magistrates' Court also heard that he habitually  walked in front  of his children -both girls - dressed only in a T-Shirt.
Magistrate Gamuchirai Siwadi spared Musoni jail  after conditionally suspending his 10-month sentence.
The magistrate described his crimes as some of  the worst form of domestic abuse he had ever come across.
The court heard that on July 1 last year, Musoni asked  his wife, Volanda Matimba, to go and buy him beer from nearby shops.
When she refused, he became abusive and hurled  insults at her. He  later went and bought the beer, but continued shouting abuse  at his  wife.
That night, Matimba and the children slept  outside in the open after Musoni had kicked them out and locked the door.
On a different day in the same month, Musoni  ordered his wife to get  into a bath tub full of water with her clothes on. He then  forced her  to spend the night standing until her clothes had dried after   threatening to throw her out of the house.
On another occasion, Musoni urinated on his wife's  back before  forcing her to roll around in the urine until it was all wiped off  the  floor while their two children watched.
Musoni, the court heard, also entered the  children's bedroom dressed only in a T-Shirt.
The two children were second and third complainants  after their mother.

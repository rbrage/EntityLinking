Missing shopper found safe and well 

A 73-year old woman who went missing while out shopping with her family on Christmas Eve has been found safe and well, police said.
Rita Wright, of Birmingham, went missing while Christmas shopping in London's busy West End at around 10.40am on Christmas Eve, the Metropolitan Police said.
She had just come out of Selfridges on Oxford Street and was heading towards Oxford Circus, the Metropolitan Police said.
Ms Wright was visiting her granddaughter's home in Kensington, west London, over the Christmas period.
She suffers from Lewy bodies (DLB), a form of dementia that shares characteristics with both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
But police said she had now been found and thanked the media for its assistance in appeals.

Travel tips 

February 6, 2006
Most common travel illnesses are caused by something you ate or something that bit you. Cover up, wear bug repellent, drink only bottled water, don't use ice cubes, make sure your food is well cooked. Visit a travel clinic before you leave to get malaria pills or antibiotics along with specific advice about health concerns where you are going. Or visit www.cdc.gov/travel for more information.

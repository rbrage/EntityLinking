Popular teacher arrested for criminal threats
April 12, 2012
Brian Miller
Police arrested a popular San Luis Obispo High School teacher on March 29 after he sent threatening emails and then created a ruckus when he refused to leave the district's continuation campus.
Brian Sanford Miller, 55, had been on voluntary leave from SLO High when he showed up at the Pacific Beach Continuation High School and asked what math classes he would be teaching in the fall of 2012. After the principal told Miller he would not be teaching any classes, Miller became upset, refused to leave and told the principal "I'm going to be on T.V. today."
Following his arrest, police discovered a threatening email miller sent to the San Luis Coastal Teachers Association the day before in which Miller describes his frustration with the association.
"Guess what builds up and explodes? Frustration, it ain't anger. Anger is wildly taking a gun and shooting someone for no reason. Guys don't snap one day and decide to shoot up their workplace instead of a convenience store. Guys snap and shoot up the office because for eight years, they got treated like ****, when they asked for help and were ridiculed. Then, they don't give a **** at some point. I'm going to the office. I will probably die there. But three random people get to die with me, their lives destroyed, just like mine," the email says
Police arrested Miller for attempted criminal threats, a felony; threatening a school employee, a felony; and disruptive presence at a school, a misdemeanor. He was booked into San Luis Obispo County Jail in lieu of $1 million bail.

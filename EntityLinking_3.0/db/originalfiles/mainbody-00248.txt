The role of Fandral was played by Josh Dallas in the first film, but is now up for grabs as Dallas' "Once Upon a Time" Season 2 shooting schedule conflicts with the upcoming sequel.
Levi was initially in talks to play the role in the first film, but was forced to bow out after "Chuck" was unexpectedly saved from cancelation.

For his part, Dallas said he's sad to be leaving Thor's side, but thrilled about the success of his ABC fairytale series, which he fondly dubbed "the best job on TV."
"I'll be missing out on wearing all that hair," the actor -- who plays David Nolan/Prince Charming on "Once Upon a Time" - jokingly told Entertainment Weekly on Friday of giving up his "Thor" character. "The timing wasn't right. I'm bummed about it because I had such a great experience and great time making the first film and was really excited about coming back.
"Marvel and Disney tried to make it work. But because of my commitment to 'Once Upon a Time,' I was not going to be able to do both," he continued. "So I'll have to hand the reins over to someone else. I love Marvel. I wish them all the best. I will certainly be first in line to see it."

The highly anticipated Marvel sequel is set to begin filming in July, THR reports, helmed by "Game of Thrones" director Alan Taylor.

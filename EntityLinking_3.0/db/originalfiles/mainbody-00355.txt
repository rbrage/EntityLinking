SHEEP and goat producers are being urged to pay more attention to their obligations when it comes to recording stock movement on the National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) database.
Biosecurity SA NLIS senior officer Denice Rendell said although compliance with ear tagging was quite good, producers needed to do more including ensuring stock was accompanied by documentation.
"Auditing of ram sales, saleyards and abattoirs has revealed that improvements need to be made in both areas," she said.
"When sheep and goats are sold or moved to another property with a different Property Identification Code (PIC), the stock must be accompanied by a correctly competed movement document.
"The term movement includes showing and agistment of stock or those animals sent for slaughter, even if for personal consumption."
Ms Rendell said all sectors of the sheep and goat industries were required to notify the NLIS database of stock movement.
This included stock movement by producers, feedlots, abattoirs and live exporters and people taking livestock to a show, field day or even a sheep dog trial.
"Penalties now exist for failing to notify the database of the movement of sheep or goats, and for providing inaccurate or incomplete documentation," she said.
She said the continued success of the sheep and goat industries was reliant on maintaining the traceability of animals at all points along the supply chain, from farm to consumer.
"The NLIS is the means by which this is achieved," she said.
"By ensuring that it works as it should, you are ensuring the prosperity of your industry now and into the future."

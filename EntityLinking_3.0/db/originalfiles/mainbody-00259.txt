Fred Nall Hollis Fred Nall Hollis, was born in 1948 in Troy, Alabama. He began to draw at four. He studied at Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris, where he became Dali's disciple. He studied at university and took degrees in Art, Political Science and Psychology. He has a very complicated artistic personality, also thanks to his being in touch with different styles and experiences: from Huichole American Indians' art to the American psychedelic art, going through Fauvism, Expressionism, Japanese lavis drawings, black-and-white drawings. His stay in Beirut and in Northern Africa, in the middle of the Seventies, gave rise to strong influences from the Arab and the Byzantine art, while in Nice he came to a turning point in his symbolism. He has won many prizes and many of his extraordinary works are in famous museums and private collections, among them there are two monumental mosaics which were commissioned by Prince Albert II of Monaco. An abundant activity which has found a lucky alliance with Festival Puccini in Torre del Lago, where Nall realized scenery and costumes for the opera "La fanciulla del West".

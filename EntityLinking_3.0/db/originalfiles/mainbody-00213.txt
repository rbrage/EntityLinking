New Rotterdam School Building for Autism Students
Posted:
 
Rotterdam - Crossroads Center for Children has a new home in Schenectady County. Families joined with local businesses and elected officials to cut the ribbon on the new state of the art facility. It's the only New York State approved Autism School in an eight county area.
The new facility comes two years after its former Saratoga County building was flooded by a water main break. Since then Crossroads has been operating out of the Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Glenville.
Crossroads opened in 1998 and has expanded its services to help school aged children from 2-12 years old. It's the only school in the area to provide an integrated setting for children with Autism to learn using a specific ABA style.
Autism is a term to describe a group of complex brain disorders which can include difficulties with social interactions and communication. About one in every 110 children is diagnosed with Autism, making it more common than childhood cancer, juvenile diabetes and pediatric AIDS combined.

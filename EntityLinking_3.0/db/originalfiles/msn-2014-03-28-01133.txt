Model Danelle happy being single
South African model Danelle de Wet says she's happy with the freedom being single affords her and only plans to settle down in a few years.
A Miss SA 2012 finalist, the 20-year-old beauty is delighted she is not encumbered by a relationship yet, as this allows her to channel her energy and undivided attention into her career.
"I love being single because there's no restrictions, and that's usually the problem because I like doing things my way," Danelle told the Daily Voice.
Danelle, however, does have a set checklist for potential suitors when the time is right.
"I have three rules. A guy can't be shorter than me, thinner than me or dumber than me," she said.
"If a guy can make me laugh, then he's already winning," Danelle added.
"My goal is settling down at 26 or 7 so I will probably need to meet my husband by 25. That gives me a couple of years."

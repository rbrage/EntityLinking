Get the look: tribal prints 

DO: If ethnic prints or fringing isn't your thing, work this summer's tribal trend with a statement jewellery piece. Ethnic accessories can transform a simple outfit into something stunning.
'JLo radiates style in this statement geometric tribal-inspired necklace,' says Nicky. 'I love how it mixes different textures, such as the solid metal with the swishy tassels, for a more unusual look.' Invest in a statement jewellery piece and you can transform the most simple, everyday pieces into something truly fashion forward, says Nicky. 'This necklace adds a touch of edginess to this otherwise simple outfit - simple yet stunning.'

After three television anime series, the Jewelpet magical girl anime franchise gets its fourth television anime series this April and its first film this August. Gekijō-ban Jewelpet Sweets Dance Princess will open in Japan on August 11.
Sanrio and Sega Toys launched their Jewelpet character and toy line in 2008, and the first Jewelpet anime followed a year later. Each Jewelpet toy is a stuffed animal; in the storyline, these pets belonged to magicians in "Jewelland" and can use magic themselves, thanks to their round jewel eyes. They study every day to learn how to use magic.
The Jewelpet franchise started out with 33 different creatures in 2008, but with the launch of the new television anime series, it will have 52 different characters. That includes 12 new Sweetspet creatures that are being introduced in the current Jewelpet Sunshine television anime series.
The story of the new film is set in Sweetsland, a country next to Jewelland. Ruby and the other Jewelpets are celebrating the birthday of the princess with dancing. However, during the preparations for the birthday party, a mysterious object appears from the skies. In the object is a Sweetspet boy, whose identity is unknown.

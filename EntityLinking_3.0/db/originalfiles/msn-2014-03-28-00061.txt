The supercar kids: Dubai's students and their incredible cars 
How can students afford expensive cars?

What did you drive when you were a student? A Nissan Micra, perhaps? Or a sensible Ford Fiesta? Or maybe you relied on the delight that is public transport?

MSN, I'm trying to figure out why you run these 'the most expensive car ever' or 'the richest people in the world ever' articles?
Your seem to have fallen for the commonly misunderstood view that people generally give a sh!t.
What people really care about is, can we trust politicians are our interests being placed before corporate nepotism and corruption? Can we trust the media not to keep peddling consumer non news as an oblique distraction from what might actually be going on under our very noses?
Answers on a post card please.

Keep this image vivid in your mind especilly when you are filling your tank at the petrol/diesel pump, unless of course you own the car?

I agree with John T - in these time of austerity when a lot of people are finding times hard, I see little relevance in showing off what little rich mummy's boy is doing with the money that a lot of people can't afford to be putting in their fuel tank. Great - a kid who has only just developed pubic hairs is driving round in a Rolls Royce or Range Rover.
Are we supposed to give a rats****?

I HOPE THAT WILL BE A NIGERIA STUDENT, NIGERIA IS A COUNTRY WHERE TREASURES ARE BEEN LOOTED WITHOUT CONTROL, WHERE NATIONAL TREASURE IS BEEN HIJACK AND BEEN MOVED OUT OF THE COUNTRY TO DEVELOP ANOTHER MAN LAND. WHERE THE POOR MASSES ARE CRYING AND NOBODY CARES TO HEAR THERE VOICE IF A STUDENT CAN BE TAKING ON SUCH MULTIMILLION CARS, HOW ABOUT HIS MOM AND DAD THEY WILL BE MOVING WITH SHIPS, WHILE IN THERE COMMUNITY PRIMARY SCHOOLS THERE IS NOT SIT IN THE CLASS ROOMS. NIGERIA IS COUNTRY WHERE CRUDE OIL IN THE SOUTH AND EASTERN REGION IS BEEN FLOWS LIKE STREAM SAVE GUIDE BY HIGH RANK INDIVIDUALS.

Samsung device hits 3m sales mark 

Sales of Samsung's Galaxy Note 2 smartphone have topped more than three million a little over a month since its launch, the company announced.
The South Korean firm said sales of the oversized smartphone reached the figure 37 days after its September release.
The Note 2 is one of the two key mobile devices from Samsung on the high-end smartphone market. It features an oversize screen that measures 5.5in diagonally and a digital pen for note-taking.
Research firm IDC estimates Samsung topped the global smartphone market in the July-September third quarter with 56.3 million sales, more than double Apple's 26.9 million iPhone sales.

Peeping Tom jailed over sex film 

A man who used his mobile phone to film a couple having sex through their bedroom window before showing it to friends in the pub has been given a 12-month prison sentence.
Sean Bailey, of Robin Gardens, Waterlooville, Hampshire, was found guilty of voyeurism after a trial at Portsmouth Crown Court.
The court heard that the 27-year-old had crept up to the ground floor window of the couple's flat and filmed them as they had sex.
He then bragged about what he had done while at a local pub and showed off the footage to a group of his friends.
Bailey, who has previous convictions including harassment and assault causing grievous bodily harm, was also placed on the sex offenders' register for 10 years.
Sentencing him, Judge Richard Price said: "You took a film of a couple having sex without their permission or agreement and then showed it to other people in the pub which is just disgusting."
Judge Price also criticised Bailey for "wasting thousands and thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money" by denying the charge throughout the seven-day trial.
Roderick James, defending, said that his client was ashamed at having committed an offence which meant he had to sign the sex offenders' register.
He said: "In the community from which he comes, there is a considerable stigma attached to this type of offending. He says 'I was too ashamed at what I had done to own up to it'."
Speaking outside court, Detective Constable Leith Morrison, of Hampshire Police, said: "He thought he was having a laugh but the offence is far more serious and the sentence reflects the seriousness of the offence he has been found guilty of."

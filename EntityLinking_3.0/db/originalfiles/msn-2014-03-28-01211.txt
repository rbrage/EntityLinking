Heidi, Spencer blew fortune to match Beckhams 

WENN
Former "Hills" stars Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag frittered away more than 
 $1 million on designer clothes and handbags in a desperate bid to become the new 
 Beckhams. The reality TV regulars ended up broke after blowing a massive $10 
 million, fearing they had to spend money before the Mayan-predicted Apocalypse 
 in December.

The couple has now opened up about how they mismanaged the cash, revealing 
 they spent a fortune on designer clothes, private jets and gold bars to hand out 
 to their friends, as well as $3,200 bottles of wine, penthouse hotel suites, 
 security guards, make-up artists and stylists. Pratt tells Britain's OK! 
 magazine, "I bought a $94,000, 1,500-pound quartz crystal from a volcano in 
 Peru. I needed a crane to put it in our house. In hindsight, that was a little 
 excessive ... When we came into all this money, we just couldn't spend it fast 
 enough. I just lost the plot ... When you start buying people cars and you're 
 not David Beckham, you're heading for trouble ... I spent over a million dollars 
 on men's clothing because I wanted people to take me seriously as an A-lister. I 
 wanted to be in the fashion magazines alongside Brad Pitt."

Montag adds, "I grew an obsession with Hermes Birkin handbags. They were, 
 like, $20,000 each. I had wardrobes full. But we wanted to keep up with the 
 Beckhams. I love Victoria's style." They also lost $2 million by setting up 
 their own record label to launch Montag's flop singing career.

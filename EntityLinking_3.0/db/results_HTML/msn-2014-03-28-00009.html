To these eyes, it still has some of the most attractive lines in its class.<br>That said, there's no doubt that it is becoming a tad familiar, just like the soon-to-be-replaced <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/017yh">BMW</a> 3 Series is.<br>New for this year are standard high-intensity headlamps highlighted by sharp LED lamps that accentuates the arrow-head design of the front end. New rims mimicking those of the $375,000+ <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/07kbbqf">Lexus LFA</a> exotic car are also part of this year's freshening.<br>And unlike the 3 Series and C-Class, at least in major cities, you won't see your car on every street corner, so it'll also provide a bit of exclusivity within the class.<br>Interior comfortable, less so roomy or artful<br>The IS 350's interior focuses on comfort rather than style, managing to maintain a clean and polished look, though quite not artfully so. <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04n7g">Lexus's</a> push for minimalist modernity would work better if it wasn't going for the same thing five years running.<br>The IS does not offer the isolationist magic carpet ride of the similarly priced <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04rv6n">Lexus ES</a>, but it's very good for the sportier end of this segment.<br>All the required trappings of a good $50,000 sport sedan are present and accounted for: leather, navi, push button ignition that prevents fumbling with the key to unlock the doors or get it started, a kicking sound system, and a host of power goodies.<br>But it also has a large hump that juts out into the driver's footwell, the all-wheel drive's transaxle making itself known to the driver's shins. Unless your feet are exceptionally large, you learn to adapt your right foot's movements to avoid it.<br>The addition of a trunk pass for the non-folding rear seats helps the IS offer a cargo solution to ski or hockey enthusiasts.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04n7g">Lexus</a> shied away from folding seats as they would have reduced the structural stiffness required to provide true sport sedan handling.<br>But combine this lack of a folding rear seat with its small-ish 378-litre trunk, and it becomes clear that the focus of the IS is more on performance than practicality.<br>It's a bit of a shame that <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04n7g">Lexus</a> didn't resurrect the SportCross hatch-wagon from the first-generation which offered greater practicality as well as fold-down seats.<br>We can only imagine how good it might look with the current car's graceful styling.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01j5hw">Fleet</a> on the road, but starting to show its age<br>There's nothing wrong with the IS's 306-hp, direct-injected 3.5-litre V6; despite being carried over without change, its output is still close to top of its class, just behind the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0511_p">Audi S4</a>, Infiniti G37 and Volvo S60 T6 making the IS 350 a leather-lined powerhouse.<br>The six-speed transmission is a smoothness-focused automatic instead of the more fashionable and responsive dual-clutch units, yet the IS 350's shift paddles react quickly when you really want to move.<br>The lack of a six-speed manual option somewhat tarnishes its enthusiast appeal, as does the lack of a modern torque-vectoring AWD system, which would have divided up the power not only front to back, but also left and right, to help handling as well as security. However, its 30/70 front-to-rear power split does help to keep the IS's handling more like the standard rear-driven car.<br>The IS was not involved in the brake pedal, steering or engine management recalls that prompted so many <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/07mb6">Toyota</a> and Lexus headlines in the past year.<br>It has also compiled impressive overall reliability and crash test scores, garnering a "Recommended" rating from <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01q1hl">Consumer Reports</a>, as well as a 2010 <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0d060g">Canadian</a> <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0b40y4">Black Book</a> Retained Value award for its top resale value among entry luxury sedans.<br>In adding all-wheel drive to the options list, the 2011 IS 350 adds a welcome bit of winter confidence to the mix, and though the practicality concerns may not make the IS 350 an ideal car for single-vehicle families, those entranced by its looks will still find it a comfortable yet engaging sport sedan.<br>2011 <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03987v">Lexus IS</a> 350 AWD<br>Price: $44,950 Type of vehicle: AWD compact luxury sedan Engines: 3.5 <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01c9x">L,</a> DOHC V6 Power/Torque: 306 hp/277 lb.-ft.

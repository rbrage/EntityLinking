"It wasn't pretty but we're not really a pretty team. We got the W and now it's on to the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0hh4">AFC</a> championship."<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01tys6s">The Ravens</a> (13-4) had almost as many punts (nine) as first downs (11) and scored only three points over the final 46 minutes. But <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01ct6">Baltimore</a> wasn't penalized once, didn't commit a turnover, intercepted rookie quarterback <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0g9yv5c">T.J. Yates</a> three times and totaled four takeaways ' two in the first quarter and two over the final eight minutes.<br>"If we didn't get any of those turnovers it would probably be a different game," <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01ct6">Ravens</a> defensive tackle <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0c2cr5">Haloti Ngata</a> said.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01ct6">Baltimore</a> visits <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05g3b">New England</a> next Sunday, with the winner advancing to the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06x5s">Super Bowl</a> in <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0ftxw">Indianapolis</a> on Feb. 5.<br>The Patriots lead the series 6-1, but <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01ct6">Baltimore's</a> lone win came in the postseason.<br>"We don't play the game until next week," <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06d8z0">Suggs</a> said. "I'm going to enjoy tonight."<br>Veteran defensive stars <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03tltt">Ed Reed</a> and Ray Lewis led a unit that yielded only one touchdown and came up with the big play when one was needed. <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01wd02c">Lewis</a> had a team-high seven tackles and <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03tltt">Reed</a> sealed the victory with the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01ct6">Ravens'</a> fourth takeaway, an interception near the goal line in the closing minutes.<br>"It's winning by any means necessary," <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03tltt">Reed</a> said. "That's what it's got to be."<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01tys6s">The Ravens</a> finished 9-0 at home, but this one was anything but easy. <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01ct6">Baltimore</a> led 17-3 after the first quarter, and interceptions by <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05h9zw6">Lardarius Webb</a> and Reed in the final 7€ minutes helped the advantage stand up.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03tltt">Reed</a> has eight interceptions in 10 playoff games, few bigger than the last one.<br>"You can't say enough about him," <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01ct6">Ravens</a> linebacker <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0bhvsb">Jarret Johnson</a> said. "His big plays always seem to happen when you need one."<br>One week earlier, in the first playoff game in <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03lsq">Texans</a> history, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03l2n">Houston</a> didn't commit a turnover in a 31-10 home rout of <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01snm">Cincinnati</a>. Against <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01ct6">Baltimore</a>, the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03lsq">Texans</a> couldn't hold onto the ball and quickly fell behind by two touchdowns.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03d17x_">Arian Foster</a> ran for 132 yards, the first player ever to rush for 100 yards against the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01ct6">Ravens</a> in the postseason. But Yates' three interceptions matched the total he had in six regular season games.<br>"I can't have the turnovers," Yates said. "If we don't turn the ball over like that, we have a chance to win. And we still had a chance to win. If I'd done a better job of protecting the football, I really think we'd have come out with the win today. We did a good job of moving the ball and we had some big plays, but you can't have that many picks."<br>Yates was the third starting quarterback used by <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03l2n">Houston</a> this season following injuries to <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05txyj">Matt Schaub</a> and Matt Leinart. The Texans also lost wide receiver <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05yn0w">Andre Johnson</a> for a spell and finished without sack specialist <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0bpbxd">Mario Williams</a>, who missed the last two-thirds of the season.<br>And still, the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03lsq">Texans</a> got within a win of reaching the conference title game. After the game, team owner <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0966fk">Bob McNair</a> pulled aside coach <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/08g8kv">Gary Kubiak</a> and congratulated him.<br>"I told him how proud I was. ... To come out and play the way this team has played, I think it's just remarkable," <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0966fk">McNair</a> said. "Where would <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05g3b">New England</a> have been if <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01xyt7">Tom</a>m) <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01xyt7">Brady</a> wasn't playing, and if <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/07vw51">Wes Welker</a> wasn't playing, and if their best defensive player wasn't playing? Go down the list of any of these teams and ask where they would be ' and they wouldn't be in the playoffs. And this team was in the playoffs."<br>Down 17-13 at halftime, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03l2n">Houston</a> twice held the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01ct6">Ravens</a> without a first down in the third quarter before driving to the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01ct6">Baltimore</a> 32. From there, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/090n1z">Neil Rackers'</a> 50-yard field goal try hit the crossbar and dropped into the end zone.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01ct6">Baltimore</a> then launched a drive in which seldom-used <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04qd2z">Lee Evans</a> made a sensational one-handed catch for a 30-yard gain on third-and-5 from the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03l2n">Houston</a> 39. On fourth-and-goal inside the 1, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02674zg">Ray Rice</a> was stuffed by linebacker <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0cx25w">Tim Dobbins</a> for no gain.<br>"That's a huge play," <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03l2n">Houston</a> defensive end <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0fq29zx">J.J. Watt</a> said. "Those are the type of plays that win playoffs games. Obviously, we wish it had gone the other way, but those are the type of plays that you remember."<br>The Texans couldn't move the ball, and the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01ct6">Ravens</a> took the ensuing punt at the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03l2n">Houston</a> 49. But three plays netted only 4 yards, and <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0d2m89">Sam Koch</a> punted for the seventh time.<br>Minutes later, the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01ct6">Ravens</a> went three and out for the fourth time in five second-half possessions. Fortunately for <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01ct6">Baltimore</a>, the defense compensated for the team's inability to add to its early lead.<br>"You have to do whatever you have to do to win a football game," <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01ct6">Ravens</a> coach <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0c2fvr">John Harbaugh</a> said.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05h9zw6">Webb's</a> second interception came with 7€ minutes left and the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01ct6">Ravens</a> clinging to 17-13 advantage. <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01ct6">Baltimore</a> moved 45 yards to get a field goal by <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/07vy9h">Billy Cundiff</a> with 2:52 left.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03l2n">Houston's</a> <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0cwkk5">Danieal Manning</a> muffled the record crowd of 71,547 by taking the opening kickoff 60 yards to the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01ct6">Baltimore</a> 41. Yates then completed two straight passes, and after the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01ct6">Ravens</a> stuffed Foster on a third-and-1, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/090n1z">Rackers</a> kicked a 40-yard field goal.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01ct6">Baltimore</a> failed to get a first down on its first possession and had to punt. <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02qw7l2">Jacoby Jones</a> inexplicably attempted to field the bouncing ball at the 13-yard line, was immediately hit by <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/043m2pm">Cary Williams</a> and lost the ball, which was recovered by <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01ct6">Baltimore</a> rookie <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0fwg0m">Jimmy Smith</a> at the 2.<br>On third down, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03d4lw7">Joe Flacco</a> threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09p6t_">Kris Wilson</a> ' the tight end's first catch of the season.<br>After a <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03l2n">Houston</a> punt, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03d4lw7">Flacco</a> completed a 21-yard pass to <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02_jvp">Anquan Boldin</a> to set up a 48-yard field goal for a 10-3 lead.<br>Later in the first quarter, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01ct6">Ravens</a> cornerback <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05h9zw6">Lardarius Webb</a> stepped in front of <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04xkpd">Johnson</a> for an interception at the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03l2n">Houston</a> 35. Five plays later, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03d4lw7">Flacco</a> tossed a 10-yard touchdown pass to <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02_jvp">Boldin</a> in the right side of the end zone.<br>Yates then completed a pair of third-down passes in a 59-yard drive that ended with a field goal.<br>After Yates misfired on third down from the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01ct6">Baltimore</a> 10, the rookie came off the field he was greeted by coach <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/08g8kv">Gary Kubiak</a>, who put a hand on the back of the quarterback's jersey while chatting.<br>Yates returned after a <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01ct6">Baltimore</a> punt to direct a 12-play, 86-yard drive that ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by Foster, who accounted for 66 yards ' including 54 on the ground.<br>Yates went 17 for 35 for 184 yards. <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04xkpd">Johnson</a> had eight catches for 111 yards.<br>Notes: Baltimore improved to 6-0 against <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03l2n">Houston</a>, 2-0 this season. ...

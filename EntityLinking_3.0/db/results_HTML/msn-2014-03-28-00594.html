He's probably not a billionaire," the newspaper said.<br>The broadsheet is backing conservative opposition leader <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02pr80">Tony Abbott</a> to win the election and said it had spent months examining <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/07kdvrf">Palmer's</a> track record.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/07kdvrf">Palmer</a>, who says he has made his money in mining and is also a real estate developer and tourism resort operator, was a long-time supporter of <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02pr80">Abbott's</a> Liberal-National coalition. He tore up his membership last year after a bitter, public dispute and set up his own party.<br>He accused Australian-born Murdoch, now a <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09c7w0">US</a> citizen, of telling his reporters what to write and said he needed to be brought to account.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06hrk">Murdoch</a>h will be sued by me today and will be brought to <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0chghy">Australia</a> to answer these questions in the Supreme Court," he told the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02h758">Seven Network</a>.<br>"It's time this fellow was brought to account, this foreigner who tries to dictate what we do."<br>In a separate interview with the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/017vb_">Nine Network</a>, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/07kdvrf">Palmer</a> made extraordinary claims about <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06hrk">Murdoch's</a> estranged wife <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04qdky">Wendi Deng</a>.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01sdhtv">'You</a>u know, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06hrk">Rupert Murdoch's</a> wife <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04qdky">Wendi Deng</a> is a <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0d05w3">Chinese</a> spy, and that's been right across the world,'' <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/07kdvrf">Palmer</a> alleged, prompting the stunned host to ask whether he had "lost the plot".<br>"She's been spying on <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06hrk">Rupert</a> for years, giving money back to <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0d05w3">Chinese</a> intelligence. She was trained in southern <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0d05w3">China</a>.

He wants to control what you think."<br>The Palmer <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/027wk2">United Party</a> is fielding candidates in each of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives and 18 Senate candidates across the eight states and territories as it spreads its populist message, which includes slashing taxation.<br></p></body></html>

At one point, one of the doctors thought she might have flesh-eating disease, that's how dark it was," <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02y_4xw">Marsha</a> Palansky said Monday.<br>"I literally broke down. I could not believe anybody could be in that condition."<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0k9j_">Peck</a> had not been washed after bowel movements, Palansky said. She died from heart and renal failure two days after being moved to the hospital.<br>The <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0ghh4d">Winnipeg Regional Health Authority</a> has apologized to <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0k9j_">Peck's</a> family and said it is reviewing standards at all nursing homes in its jurisdiction.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02h758">Seven</a> nurses have been disciplined, including one who no longer works at the home, and the facility has implemented an improvement plan.<br>"It should not have happened," said Real Cloutier, the authority's chief operating officer.<br>"A big part of this was ... just not following the protocols in place."<br>Palansky said she hopes no one else will go through what she has.<br>"I'm hoping that this home becomes a quality long-term care home," she said. "But I don't think a lot of education (of staff) has happened."<br> <br>Related Video<br>Please install the latest version of the free <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05qh6g">Adobe Flash Player</a>.<br>Download now.<br>For help with <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/058b6">Flash</a>, see <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0vlf">Adobe's</a><br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05qh6g">Flash Player</a> Support page.<br> <br> <br> <br><br></p></body></html>

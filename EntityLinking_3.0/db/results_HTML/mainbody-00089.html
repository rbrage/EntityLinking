The <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0jbhs">USDA</a> is planning to launch the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/047mqwl">National Institute of Food and Agriculture</a>, which will address the issues of food safety, nutrition and obesity and will be modeled after the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0chvn">National Institutes of Health</a> (<a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0chvn">NIH</a>).<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/064l9gm">Shah</a> met with <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05dxkg">Donald</a> <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/088b9x">Tobias</a>, CUCE-NYC's executive director, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/044zy">Julian</a> Imperato-McGinley, associate dean of translational research and education at <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05jbwb">Weill Cornell Medical College</a>, and several CUCE-NYC staff members Sept. 25 at the CUCE-NYC offices on E. 34th <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0x35">St.</a> in <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0cc56">Manhattan</a> to learn about <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01w3v">Cornell's</a> programs serving the metropolitan area.<br>He also toured the Food and Finance High School, a public high school in midtown <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0cc56">Manhattan</a> where <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01w3v">Cornell</a> has instituted the Hydroponics Learning Model in which students raise edible fish and plants in tanks. He ate lunch there as well, which was prepared by the culinary arts students.<br>CUCE-NYC's nutrition and health education programs seemed to interest <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/064l9gm">Shah</a> the most, according to <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/088b9x">Tobias</a>. "He was very interested in the size [of the programs] and the methods we were using in nutrition education," <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/088b9x">Tobias</a> said. "He seemed to be particularly interested in what we were doing in the schools and the Kitchens of Faith community."<br>Eighteen churches in <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02_286">New York City</a> have become Kitchens of Faith by completing an eight-session training program emphasizing nutrition; they also participate in regular videoconference sessions in which health care professionals answer their questions.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/064l9gm">Shah</a> also appeared to be keen to know more about the Urban <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/022x47">4-H</a> programs that CUCE-NYC runs, as he said that he thought <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/022x47">4-H</a> is "usually associated with raising livestock." The Urban <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/022x47">4-H</a> tends to attract older youths and has a focus on the community, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/088b9x">Tobias</a> explained. The teens create public service announcements, devise a curriculum on human sexuality and practice public speaking.<br>"A number of times throughout the day," <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/088b9x">Tobias</a> said, "[Shah] talked about how the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0rh6k">Washington</a> perception of cooperative extension is of a rural orientation. <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/064l9gm">Shah</a> left <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02_286">New York City</a> enthusiastic about telling the story of urban extension."<br>Another area that intrigued <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/064l9gm">Shah</a>, noted <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/088b9x">Tobias</a>, was the partnership between CUCE-NYC and the medical college through the Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC), a consortium that includes <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/053mcb">Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center</a> and Hunter College School of Nursing. CTSC links research, clinical practice and community to rapidly improve the health status of <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02_286">New Yorkers</a>. While this partnership is unique, it is one that could be replicated among other institutions, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/088b9x">Tobias</a> added.<br>"[Shah] is interested in publicizing this model to land-grant universities across the country," <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/088b9x">Tobias</a> said.<br>Liz Borod Wright '99 is a freelance writer in <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02_286">New York City</a>.<br>##<br>| September story index | Cornell Chronicle Online Home Page |<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0ytz5">Sabina</a> <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06f5j">Lee</a><br>Susan Lang<br><br></p></body></html>

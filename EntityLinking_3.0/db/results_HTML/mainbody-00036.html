By age thirteen, she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05mnc3">Kate</a>, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood. The product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0329l4">Anna</a> was conceived as a bone marrow match for <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05mnc3">Kate</a> -- a life and a role that she has never challenged...until now. Like most teenagers, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0329l4">Anna</a> is beginning to question who she truly is. But unlike most teenagers, she has always been defined in terms of her sister -- and so <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0329l4">Anna</a> makes a decision that for most would be unthinkable, a decision that will tear her family apart and have perhaps fatal consequences for the sister she loves.<br>My Sister's Keeper (February 2005)<br>Format: Paperback Place of publication: <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02_286">New York</a> Publisher: Washington Square Press ISBN: 0743454537 Dimensions: 8.23 x 5.32 x 1.18 Pages: 448<br><br></p></body></html>

Cumbria County Council says it is ready for this winter's icy blast.<br>The gritters can be fitted with snow ploughs and two new four wheel drive trucks - with snow blowers - are on hand to tackle some of the county's highest roads.<br>The county council says it cannot grit every road so it concentrates on a "core network of priority routes".<br>"First priority routes are gritted within three hours and second priority within five," a spokesman said.<br>"Minor roads are only gritted once these priority routes are done."<br>Use this page to let us know if the roads in your area are not being gritted, your salt bin is empty - or if people are hard at work keeping routes safe and open.<br>You can also use it to tell us what the conditions are like where you are.<br>Don't forget to send pictures if you spot empty salt bins or sheet ice on untreated roads.

"A lot of the warmer colors are very popular. We're seeing orange, salmon, teal, greens."<br>In addition, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0fsty_">Quittner</a> said, themes are gravitating toward Old World <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/07kg3">Tuscan</a>, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/07_pf">Venetian</a>, Nautical or <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01p03_">Asian</a> motifs that carry the design throughout the entire room.<br>"The bathroom is no longer the forgotten room of the house," he said. <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02jqxw">People</a>e want it to blend with the other rooms.

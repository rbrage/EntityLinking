But their routes here are also rendered dangerous by <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/048jvp">Rocinha's</a> maze of narrow streets and steep cliffside drops.<br>And then there's the fact that, as the area develops, some ramshackle abodes vanish and new ones spring up.<br>Just finding an address often requires a real sleuth.<br>"Sometimes, to get to a resident you have to go through the kitchen of another house," Martins told <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02dlk9">AFP</a>.<br>Shanty houses dot the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06gmr">Rio</a> hillside, with the structures providing shelter to tens of thousands -- many work-hungry migrants from <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/015fr">Brazil's</a> poverty-stricken northeast.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/048jvp">Rocinha</a> was a lawless bastion of drug dealers for some 30 years until troops and police, backed by helicopters and armored vehicles, moved in two years ago.<br>Since then, authorities have attempted to modernize the area and draw up a registry of streets, number houses and generally make some sense of a maze of paths and a jumble of electrical wires.<br>The postal service, for one, is tasked with attributing a zip code to each region to enable residents to get their mail at home.<br>"Before, road number four was just a simple pathway; today it's a real road, wider. That makes our job easier," says mailman <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05x_29">Ricardo Pinto</a>, 52.<br>Previously, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/012s89">Pinto</a> and his colleagues would barely venture into <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/048jvp">Rocinha's</a> main street for fear of coming face to face with armed men.<br>Instead, they would drop the mail off with traders or residents would come pick it up.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01h1bf">Today</a>, six mailmen do the rounds on foot, delivering some 5,200 items per day to houses on streets with a designated name.<br>A truck, meanwhile, serves as a "poste restante," where people can come and collect items.<br>Even so, Martins said, "these postmen still only cover around 30 percent of <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/048jvp">Rocinha</a>."<br>One particularly tough neighborhood to navigate is above the "Valao" -- <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/048jvp">Rocinha's</a> open sewer system -- where the roads are unnamed.<br>Friendly neighborhood service<br>"Our work starts where that of the postal service stops," <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0159q0">Silas</a> <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01hfh_">Vieira</a>, 44, told <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02dlk9">AFP</a>.<br>"We go into little alleyways which haven't been registered, to houses with no number."<br>Along with <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0bxn0q">Carlos</a> <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03hnxxq">Pedro</a>, 43, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01hfh_">Vieira</a> founded "Carteiro Amigo" ("Friendly Postman") 13 years ago with an unemployment insurance payout.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01h1bf">Today</a>, their small company employs seven "mailmen" -- albeit ones who are not recognized by the official postal service.<br>They deliver mail to more than 8,000 households, which each pay around $7 a month for the service.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01hfh_">Vieira</a> and Pedro both hail from <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/048jvp">Rocinha</a> and have drawn up their own address registry based on names given by locals to some 3,000 pathways, alleyways, squares and even staircases.<br>Creating that was "a real detective's job," they said.<br>Neither <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01hfh_">Vieira</a> nor <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03hnxxq">Pedro</a> will say what kind of revenue their fledgling firm has -- but they do let on that turnover has "tripled in ten years."<br>They have also opened franchises in ten other favelas.<br>Another colleague, a 32-year-old who only gave his name as <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04rwkd">Max</a>, finds the work keeps him in shape as he logs some 10 kilometers (6.25 miles) a day on his route.<br>His work is highly appreciated by the locals.<br>"He has changed my life," said Norma Lucia, a woman in her 50s, as <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04rwkd">Max</a> handed her a letter.<br>Yet some complain about having to pay for a service that elsewhere in <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06gmr">Rio</a> de Janeiro is provided for free.<br>"The post is a public service," complained a man who identified himself as <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0378hn">Jose</a>, 55.<br>Some two million people live in <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06gmr">Rio's</a> favelas.<br>Those in the southern part of the city have gradually been "pacified" since 2008 as authorities try to spruce up the metropolis ahead of next year's <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/030q7">World Cup</a> and the 2016 Rio Olympics.<br>Even so, many slum residents still lack basic services such as drinking water, sewage systems, refuse collection -- and mail delivery.<br></p></body></html>

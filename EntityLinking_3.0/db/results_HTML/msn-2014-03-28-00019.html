But it was the kind of sell-off you don't like to see. The Dow <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/027y6nh">Jones</a> industrials( $INDU) were up as many as 83 points on the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01zj1t">Home Depot</a> news -- and lost all of the gain and then some.

The <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/015wl_">S&P</a> 500 dropped 2.4% last week, the worst week for the index since June. The drop was partly propelled by concerns about whether there will be a timely solution to avoid the "fiscal cliff," the combination of tax increases and federal spending cuts set to take effect on <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/026v5">Dec</a>. 31.<br>More<br>The major averages see small gains but fall for the week as sparring begins between the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/081sq">White House</a> and House Speaker Boehner on fixing the fiscal cliff. <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0k8z">Apple</a> rallies after three big losses. <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09b3v">Disney</a> sags.

It succeeded with very small gains, but the major averages still had their worst weekly performance in five months. If you want to thank someone for at least halting the losses this week, thank consumers, who are more confident about the economy. Thank <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0k8z">Apple</a>( <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0k8z">AAPL</a>), which rallied today after three straight declines.

Kayak shares were up $8.63 to $39.67. The wild card for the market today has been <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0rh6k">Washington</a> and the fiscal cliff -- the mixture of government spending cuts and tax hikes set to take effect <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02pkb1c">Jan</a>. 1.

There's talk investors are starting to ask what the company's next big wonder product might be. <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/07gyp7">McDonald's</a> was off $1.73 to $85.13 and was the biggest weight on the Dow Jones Industrial Average( $INDU), which fell for the second day in a row.

Late selling caused to the Dow Jones Industrial Average( $INDU) to finish down more than 300 points, its largest loss since Nov. 9, 2011. The blue-chip index ended the day below 13,000 for the first time since Aug. 2, and the major <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09c7w0">U.S.</a> averages were all down at least 2.4%. Bank stocks were the weakest sector in part because it's likely the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill will remain largely intact. In addition, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01qh39">Elizabeth Warren</a>, a critic of many <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09c7w0">U.S.</a> banking practices, won a seat in the U.S. Senate. <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01hlwv">JPMorgan Chase</a>( <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01hlwv">JPM</a>), a critic of bank regulation, was down $2.32 to $40.56. Health insurance stocks were lower because the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Reform Act -- aka Obamacare -- is likely to stay in place. Meanwhile, oil prices fell back sharply in part because of worries about global demand. <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02j9z">Europe</a> became a worry after <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02l6_">European Central Bank</a> President <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09lfbm">Mario Draghi</a> said he expected no change to the weak eurozone economy in the near future.

The Dow <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/027y6nh">Jones</a> industrials( $INDU) finished up more than 130 points and, in two days, made back all of their losses on Friday in a rally built on gains for big energy, industrial and financial stocks. <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02d4jl">AT&T</a>( T) and Intel( <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03s7h">INTC</a>) were the only Dow stocks not to finish in the black. <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03s7h">Intel</a> was hit by a report that <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0k8z">Apple</a>( <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0k8z">AAPL</a>) is thinking about replacing Intel-made chips in its Macintosh computers. Oil prices were higher on worries that Superstorm Sandy has cut into domestic supplies of crude oil and refined energy products. The Energy Department will report on <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09c7w0">U.S.</a> inventories on Wednesday. Gold(-GC) moved above $1,700 for the first time in three days.

It was a day of low volume as many investors and traders began to hunker down, awaiting election returns. There was some strength in technology shares, in part because <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0k8z">Apple</a>( <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0k8z">AAPL</a>) said it sold 3 million <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09rvlp4">iPad</a> tablet devices over the weekend -- a possible signal of a strong holiday season. <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0k8z">Apple</a> finished up $7.82 to $584.62; the shares had reached as high as $587.77. Housing stocks were higher, although there was no news. But investors appear to be betting that the rebound in housing activity that began this year will continue in 2013 regardless of who wins the presidential election on Tuesday.

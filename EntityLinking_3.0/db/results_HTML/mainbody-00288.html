I love her, she's so brilliant. I don't think `Rollin' in the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0gnm2b">Deep'</a> would exist if it wasn't for <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04bcrl">Wanda Jackson</a>" - <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02z4b_8">Adele</a> Widely known and respected as the Queen of Rock & First lady of Rockabilly, we are delighted to announce that <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04bcrl">Wanda Jackson</a> is not just appearing at <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03vnlw">Bluesfest</a> next easter, but is also embarking on sideshow dates in several major cities. Wanda has influenced generations of both male and female performers, and is now playing the best ever shows of her life! Wanda's latest rediscovery in 2011 saw her team up with <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01vsnff">Jack White</a> to produce her wildly successful album "The Party Ain't Over" and has since been working on her 31st studio album "Unfinished Business" with folk musician and <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03vnlw">Bluesfest</a> performer <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05b5hn7">Justin Townes Earle</a>. The album features performances of <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/064dv4">Woody</a> Guthries "California Stars" and <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0267bc_">Bobby</a> and Shirley Womack's "It's All Over Now" that was released October 2012. <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0gr9_">Born</a> in <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05mph">Oklahoma</a>, Wanda first toured in 1955 when placed on a bill with none other than `The King' himself, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02jq1">Elvis Presley</a>. The two hit it off almost immediately and dated on and off. Wanda has since mentioned that is was <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02jq1">Elvis</a> along with her father <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0bxtg">Tom</a>, himself a country singer, who encouraged her to sing rockabilly. In 2009, Wanda became the only woman ever to be inducted into both the Rockabilly and Rock and Roll Hall of Fames (on recommendation of <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01vrncs">Bob Dylan</a>, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02vr7">Elvis Costello</a> and Bruce Springsteen). Throughout Wanda's 50+ year multi genre music career hits like "Tears Will Be the Chaser for Your Wine", "Fujiyama Mama", "Heart Trouble" and "I Remember<a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02jq1">Elvis</a>s", have landed her in the top of the country, rockabilly, pop and rock charts. Wanda continues to tour all over the world to sold out crowds of adoring fans, and now its our turn. If you can't make it to <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03vnlw">Bluesfest</a> next <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02j_4">Easter</a> then be sure to see the undisputed Queen of Rockabilly when she hits your town.`Wanda Jackson positively killed with her set at Venue last Saturday. Volatile as nitro-glycerine, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09889g">Jackson</a> exudes charms, sexuality, sincerity and humble honesty; often in the same verse...Her voice is a true gift to humanity'.- <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/080h2">Vancouver</a> Weekly, September 2012 Event Type: Music & Clubs Genres: Pop and Rock Web Address: www.wandajackson.com Notify us of changes Add to Outlook Calendar Print<br><br></p></body></html>

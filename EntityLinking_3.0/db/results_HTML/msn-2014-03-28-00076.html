Designed for those who want a family car, but quite like the safety and visibility of a higher 4x4-style vehicle - even though few actually are powered by all four wheels. It is unashamedly aimed at the urban school-run market, rather than the rural buyer, although I'm sure <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0czgc">Mitsubishi</a> will sell you one whoever you are.<br>Where does it fit?<br>Three years ago <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05b4c">Nissan</a> largely had this market to itself with its <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0cbnxm">Qashqai</a>, which offered 4x4-cum-mini-MPV practicality and driving position at <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/027qpg5">Ford Focus</a> prices. It sold strongly, something noticed by everyone else - and now in 2010 <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0czgc">Mitsubishi</a> enters a crowded market, with new or recent competitors in the shape of: <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01cytr">Kia's</a> <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/040m82">Sportage</a>, the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0f4v1">Peugeot</a> 3008, the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05_5ppm">Skoda Yeti</a>, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0blws">Hyundai's</a> <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0fr0t">Tucson</a> - as well as the market-leading <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05b4c">Nissan</a>. In the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0czgc">Mitsubishi</a> world, it sits slightly above the quirky MIEV supermini and Colt - but below the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/047ptj">Lancer</a>, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02m6x0">Lancer Evo</a>, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04pj2g">Outlander</a> 4x4, and Shogun large 4x4.<br>As such the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01c02f">ASX</a> represents an attempt by <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0czgc">Mitsubishi</a> to reposition itself away from its famous performance and 4x4 cars and towards a more touchy-feely environmentally friendly market position. The vast majority of ASXs will be front-wheel drive only, like this one tested.<br>Is it for you?<br>Do you have a smallish, young family? Do you like the idea of space and decent car handling - but the advantage of a high-driving position? All at more or less the same prices as a conventional family hatchback such as a Golf or <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01j3dc">Astra</a>? Then most definitely. Some of the motor industry's niches make little sense apart from to car marketing executives but this isn't one of them.<br>What does it do well?<br>Space and pace. It is built on the same chassis as its big brother <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04pj2g">Outlander</a> model, and has the same wheelbase, which gives it a nice spacious interior and none of the inverse-tardisness of so many SUV-type vehicles. But crucially it is a good 34cms shorter than the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04pj2g">Outlander</a>, giving it a smaller footprint than a Focus.<br>All this is married to a peachy new 1.8-litre turbodiesel engine which revs freely and happily and gives the car a real petrol-style urge - as we found on some interesting roads between <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/095l0">Bristol</a> and Bath. Good for a chunky 147hp, it delivers a useful 221 lb ft of torque at 2,000rpm - plenty enough to shove its 1,450kg around.<br>And it drives really well. Because it's high but not too high it suffers none of the swaying suffered by larger 4x4s and there is little body-roll during sharp-cornering. It is an eager little beaver.<br>What doesn't it do well?<br>It is a decent enough car to look at, but the slight downwards roofline swoop comes at familiar cost: limited rear-headroom; just about <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05mph">OK</a> for me, but no good for <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03y5_6">Peter Crouch</a>, for example. The dashboard is sensible enough but I couldn't get away from the feeling of to-a-budget plastics. I thought the car's cloth seats were adequate rather than brilliant, though my companion complained about a lack of lumbar support which passed me by: if you have back problems, then drive it first.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03t28q">What's</a> it like to live with?<br>The dials and colour information are very clear and easy-to-follow, though I'm unsure about the 'See you' message which pops up when you turn off the engine. The car is spacious and even though I am lanky I thought rear legroom was pretty good overall. The boot is large and usefully shaped (442 litres seats-up, 1,193 litres seats down), while there is an excellent 30-litre lift-up secret compartment which is room enough for a fair-sized laptop bag. I didn't get the chance to give the car my usual 'does it fit a folded-up pushchair' test but it seemed wide enough for me.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/021p7y">Standard</a> equipment across the range includes air-conditioning, seven airbags, keyless go, reach and rake adjustable steering, a range of stability controls, and an audio jack for your music player. Posher versions feature sat-nav, full-on integrated <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0mcx2">iPod</a> controls, and a reversing camera, among other things.<br>How green is it?<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0432zh">Strong</a>, if not class leading. This 1.8- DiD model is good for 51.4mpg combined and 145g CO2/km, while under fairly hard driving we managed 45mpg. Decent - though the best 3008 does just 130g and the best <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0cbnxm">Qashqai</a> does 129g CO2/km. Its green credentials are aided by across-the-range economy enhancing features including Auto Stop & Go stop-start, electric power steering, regenerative brakes, low consumption LED rear-lights, and low roll-resistance tyres. It also has the best drag coefficient in its class.<br>Would we buy it?<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0b_xm">Yes</a>. It looks good, drives well, has a lovely engine, and is competitively priced. It also promises strong residuals and should be cheaper to insure than most of its rivals since <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0czgc">Mitsubishi</a> has worked hard to keep parts prices down - as a result ASXs are a good three or four insurance groups lower than the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0cbnxm">Qashqai's</a>. There is also a low-cost servicing deal which is well worth taking up. The warranty is three years. On paper thus the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01c02f">ASX</a> acquits itself well - but it has some strong competitors: the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01c02f">ASX</a> does not have quite the interior quality of the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0cbnxm">Qashqai</a>, nor its impish charm. But it is definitely well worth a test drive.<br>Our test car was €18,549. The 1.6-litre petrol version (arriving September 2010) of this trim level is a lot cheaper at €16,799 - but will have rather weaker residual value: it will hold onto 32% after three years vs 35% for the diesel, according to CAP.<br></p></body></html>

When it is tilted towards the user it will display information about as missed calls and battery life while the home screen remains locked.<br>The phone also boasts a 13-megapixel camera and 3GB of ram, and it will be compatible with <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01nn79">Samsung's</a> recently released <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02wxtgw">Android</a> Smartwatch.<br>The Galaxy Round will be available from tomorrow, but only in <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06qd3">South Korea</a>. The company has yet to confirm a global rollout. <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09gglg_">Rival</a> phone-maker <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04k024">LG</a> has said it will release its own curved handset next year.<br>"It's a step forward for having unbreakable gadgets and flexible devices eventually," said <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0s0g7">Hana</a> Daetoo Securities analyst, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03r13h">Nam</a> Dae-jong. Although the shell of the Galaxy Round is rigid, the display within it is flexible. That means it is less likely to be damaged by an impact to the screen.<br>Reactions from critics have been generally positive, although not everyone is convinced by the need for a curvy phone.<br>The stand-out feature for <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0b754cg">Jessica</a> Dolcourt of CNET? Well obviously it's that "eyeful of a smile that's unmistakably laughing at you for ever doubting it in the first place," she says.<br>Aside from its aesthetic appeal, however, Dolcourt questions the worth of the curved screen.<br>"It still isn't entirely clear what the benefits are of a display that's so deeply, horizontally curved like the Round. Maybe it will fit your cheek - or your pocket," she says. "Or maybe it's just because <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01nn79">Samsung</a> has the cash to experiment."<br>Devindra Hardawar of Venture Beat argues that curved screens point the way to the future.<br>"They're paving the way for more intriguing screen shapes down the line," he says, "potentially even truly flexible displays." â‚¬<br></p></body></html>

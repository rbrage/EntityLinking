For instance a London-Cardiff off-peak return rises 9.7%, with London-Exeter going up 9.6% and London-Plymouth also increasing by 9.6%. Anytime-return fare rises that are well above average include Birmingham-Edinburgh (up 8.4% compared with January 2011) and Bristol-Edinburgh (up 8.3%).<br>However, Passenger Focus said it felt that unregulated fares had "not been hit in the same way as in previous years" and that it hoped this policy continued. Passenger Focus chief executive <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0cwn_0">Anthony Smith</a> said: "Passengers will have to dig deep in their pockets to cover the 6%-and-more fare rises coming into effect on Monday. Whatever the weather, these rail fare rises will make for a frosty return to work."<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02qvrlf">Michael Roberts</a>, chief executive of the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01bs4f">Association of Train Operating Companies</a>, said: "Money raised through fares helps to pay for better services. For a number of years, the Government has sought to sustain investment in the railways by reducing what taxpayers contribute and increasing the share that is paid for by passengers.<br>"The focus of the whole industry is to keep on reducing the overall cost of running the railways as a way of limiting future fare rises and providing taxpayers with better value for money."<br></p></body></html>

One <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05d49">Nairobi</a> hospital treated 437 rape victims over 60 last year.<br>At the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/064ng5l">Korogocho</a> community hall, elderly women clad in headscarves, long skirts and petticoats pounded punchbags with the heels of their bare feet.<br>"No, no, no!" screamed <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04sv4">Ms</a> Wangui as she forced <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04sv4">Ms</a> Kariuki backwards with a series of open-palm blows on a hitting pad, cheered by a group of around 30 women aged between 50 and 80.<br>"When we hit the pad with an open palm we are training to target the nose, the solar plexus or the groin to hurt an attacker so that it can give you a chance to escape. Shouting 'no' repetitively is meant to draw the attention of people so that they can assist you," said <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04sv4">Ms</a> Wangui, who has been training for almost two years.<br>"Don't feel any mercy. Was he coming to read the Bible with you?" <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04sv4">Ms</a> Kariuki asks the women.<br>One of the causes of elderly rape is a belief by criminals that sex with an elderly women can cure them of Aids. Others think raping an elderly woman will cleanse their sins after committing crimes, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04sv4">Ms</a> Kariuki said.<br>Ten elderly women have been raped and killed in <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/064ng5l">Korogocho</a> over the last two years, but no suspects have been arrested. Many other rapes are believed to have taken place but not reported.<br></p></body></html>

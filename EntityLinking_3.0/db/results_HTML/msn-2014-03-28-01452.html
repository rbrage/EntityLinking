It's no wonder, given the mandatory time off workers get there, with the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0f8l9c">French</a> guaranteed a whopping 30 days.<br>While <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02j9z">Europeans'</a> generous vacations can inspire either longing or ridicule in <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09c7w0">Americans</a>, it's worth noting that there's no apparent correlation between paid vacations and worker satisfaction.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03rjj">Italian</a> workers, for instance, score lower than <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09c7w0">U.S.</a> employees in satisfaction, yet they are given 20 paid vacation days per year, on top of 11 paid holidays, the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0j3b">Atlantic</a> reports, citing research from <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0277mtl">Mercer</a> and a worker satisfaction survey from <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02_cbn">Randstad</a>.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/059j2">The Netherlands</a>, meanwhile, scores highest on worker satisfaction, yet it resides in the middle of the pack when it comes to <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02j9z">European</a> vacation time, the piece notes.<br>What explains the discrepancy? <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/059j2">Dutch</a> workers enjoy higher incomes than other <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02j9z">European</a> workers and have short work schedules. On top of that, they receive something called vakantiegeld(literally, vacation money) before taking a summer break.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03rjj">Italian</a> workers are dealing with a host of troubles, ranging from a shrinking economy to outrageously high unemployment rates for young people.<br>Why do <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09c7w0">American</a> workers score high on satisfaction while lacking in guaranteed vacation? The reason might be simply that <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09c7w0">U.S.</a> workers don't usually get firsthand experience with how <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02j9z">Europeans</a> live. Because most of us don't often witness <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0f8l9c">French</a> workers languishing on sandy beaches during August, it's not actually rubbed in our faces.<br>Satisfaction with vacation time scored relatively high in a 2012 survey of <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09c7w0">U.S.</a> workers from <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0dhqxv">Gallup</a>. Nearly three-quarters of <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09c7w0">American</a> workers said they were either completely or somewhat satisfied with the amount of vacation time they received.<br>So what bugs <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09c7w0">American</a> workers? On-the-job stress and income, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0dhqxv">Gallup</a> found.<br>Even when <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09c7w0">Americans</a> get vacation time, they don't always take it. About 57% of <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09c7w0">U.S.</a> workers had unused vacation time at the end of 2011, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03m3wyd">CNNMoney</a> reports, using data from <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0bsrlb">Harris Interactive</a>.<br>Workers cited too much work or the fact that they didn't have enough money to travel. And when <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09c7w0">Americans</a> do take a vacation, they are often still tied to work via smartphones or laptops.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02w8c_">Given</a> that the concept of a vacation is increasingly foreign to the "no-vacation nation," <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09c7w0">Americans</a> are apparently instead judging work satisfaction on issues like pay and flexible hours instead.<br></p></body></html>

He became obsessed with rock music as a teenager (especially with such heavyweights as <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01czx">Black Sabbath</a> and Led Zeppelin). After joining his first band in high school, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/060nc">Paul</a> started playing clubs in <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0h7h6">Toronto</a> before he was legally old enough to be in them, learning the ropes as a rock drummer.<br>From 1988 to 2003, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/060nc">Paul</a> was a member of <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0h7h6">Toronto</a> acts <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/099nqg">Roxy</a> Lane, Vertical Creep and Flat Planet, playing in every dive across the country and occasionally featured as the opening act on bills that included bands such as <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05fz3">Nazareth</a>, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03cfnr">Jeff Healey</a>, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/013w8h">Ted Nugent</a>, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/020vns">April Wine</a> and others. More recently, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/060nc">Paul</a> has gigged in many cover acts and toured with tributes to <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0ycfj">Van Halen</a>, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01czx">Black Sabbath</a> and Alice Cooper.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/060nc">Paul</a> is completely self taught, but has strived to be a better "technical drummer", so he looked for some insight. After one lesson with <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01jx6c1">Robb Reiner</a> of Anvil,  <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06jz0">Reiner</a> told <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/060nc">Paul</a>, "You do everything wrong, but you're pretty good at it. Save your money, kid." <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06jz0">Reiner's</a> candor convinced <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/060nc">Paul</a> that he was on the right path, and over the years <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/060nc">Paul</a> has focused on "being the best" at "doing everything wrong."<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/060nc">Paul's</a> influences include the obvious - <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01wh7v1">Jason Bonham</a> and Neil Peart, but <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/060nc">Paul</a> is also a huge fan of Faith No More/ Ozzy Osbourne drummer <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/051gyk">Mike Bordin</a>, whose powerful playing defines to <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/060nc">Paul</a>  what rock drumming is all about: loud, heavy and simple.

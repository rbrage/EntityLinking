The Office of Emergency and Remedial Response (Superfund) uses these documents in preparing cost-benefit analyses under Executive Order 12991 for decision-making under CERCLA. All estimates of acceptable intakes and carcinogenic potency presented in this document should be considered as preliminary and reflect limited resources allocated to this project. The intent in these assessments is to suggest acceptible exposure levels whenever sufficient data are available. The interim values presented reflect the relative degree of hazard associated with exposure or risk to the chemical(s) addressed. Whenever possible, two categories of values have been estimated for systemic toxicants (toxicants for which cancer is not the endpoint of concern). The first, RfDS or subchronic reference dose, is an estimate of an exposure level that would not be expected to cause adverse effects when exposure occurs during a limited time interval. The RfD is an estimate of an exposure level that would not be expected to cause adverse effects when exposure occurs for a significant portion of the lifespan. For compounds for which there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity, ql*s have been computed, if appropriate, based on oral and inhalation data if available.<br>Technical Information Staff<br>by phone at:   703-347-8561 by fax at:   703-347-8691 by email at:  nceadc.comment@epa.gov<br>Additional Information<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0156dy">Project</a> Officer Chris DeRosa, FTS 684-7534<br>Citation<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0g0lh">U.S. EPA</a>.

(him) for what happens from here on," <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01jwbg">Fernando</a> Mazanga told <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02dlk9">AFP</a>.<br>"The guerrillas are scattered and will attack without taking any orders," he said.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/036xy7">Renamo</a>, which took up arms against the then-communist <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/024xxy">Mozambique Liberation Front</a> (<a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/024xxy">Frelimo</a>) after independence from <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05r4w">Portugal</a> in 1975, declared Monday that it had pulled out of the peace agreement that ended that bitter conflict.<br>Return to war 'unlikely'<br>Mazanga said Monday's attack on its base "marks the end of multiparty democracy" in <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04wlh">Mozambique</a>.<br>But the declaration should be taken with a "pinch of salt", <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09gjv99">South African Institute of International Affairs</a> researcher Aditi Lalbahadur told <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02dlk9">AFP</a>.<br>"It's very unlikely that you are going to see a return to war."<br>Lalbahadur said that <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/036xy7">Renamo</a> lacked the capacity to engage in a full-scale conflict and that war was not in the interests of the government with its more powerful armed forces.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04wlh">Mozambique</a>e is trying very much to attract foreign investment into the country so any type of political instability works to their disadvantage," Lalbahadur added.<br>Heading into local government polls next month and a national vote in 2014, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04wlh">Mozambique</a> has a history of election-related violence.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/036xy7">Renamo</a>, which has faced dwindling political support, demands more representation on election bodies and in the armed forces.<br>While electoral reforms are acknowleged as necessary, the former rebels have been accused of failing to offer a counter-proposal.<br>Tensions between the rival sides began escalating last year after <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06bs00">Dhlakama</a> set up camp in the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04y5p3q">Gorongosa</a> mountains and began retraining former guerrilla fighters.<br>"You're seeing a <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/036xy7">Renamo</a> that has always ever spoken the language of war... and you're seeing it again in a context where they have lost a lot of support over the years," Lalbahadur said.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0231r">Charles</a> Laurie, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0hzlz">Africa</a> expert with the London-based risk analysts <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0h_bp_0">Maplecroft</a>, agrees.<br>"I really see the extent of these recent incidents as in fact being a sign of weakening political prospects for <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/036xy7">Renamo</a> whilst of course acknowledging that these are worrying military events, worrying incidents of conflict," he said.<br>The assault on the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/036xy7">Renamo</a> base came after the former rebels attacked a government military unit on Thursday.<br>Defence ministry spokesman Custodio Chume told state broadcaster Radio Mozambique that Monday's assault on the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/036xy7">Renamo</a> base was in response to that attack.<br>The <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04wlh">Mozambican</a> civil war, which ended after <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/036xy7">Renamo</a> lost its Cold War backers <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06jnv">Rhodesia</a> and apartheid <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0hzlz">South Africa</a>, killed about one million people.<br></p></body></html>

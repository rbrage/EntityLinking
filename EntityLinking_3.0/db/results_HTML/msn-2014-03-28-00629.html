world watching as <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06vbd">Syria</a> vows to free evacuees <br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06vbd">Syria</a> sought to give reassurances Thursday about the fate of men and boys detained during the evacuation from rebel-held areas of <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0k9qf">Homs</a> city, as <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0rh6k">Washington</a> warned the world is watching.<br><br>In <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06mzp">Switzerland</a>, international mediator <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02l9kb">Lakhdar Brahimi</a> was to meet representatives of the two co-sponsors on the so-called <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03902">Geneva</a> II peace talks, the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09c7w0">United States</a> and Russia.<br>However, there were no direct meetings planned between the two sides in the deadly conflict on day four of the second round of the process.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0k9qf">Homs</a> governor <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/024rqr">Talal</a> al-Barazi said men arrested by the authorities after being evacuated from besieged districts of <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0k9qf">Homs</a> under a UN-brokered ceasefire will be released on Thursday.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0m2l9">Young</a>g men aged between 18 and 54 will be freed today," he said, without specifying how many would be released.<br>Barazi said 390 men of weapons-bearing age had been detained for interrogation after being evacuated from rebel-held districts.<br>On Wednesday, he said that 111 had been released, though there was no immediate confirmation from the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/07t65">UN,</a> which had earlier said 42 were freed.<br>Anti-regime activists say they fear arrest if they leave the rebel-controlled enclaves.<br>The State Department said <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0rh6k">Washington</a> expected <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06vbd">Syria</a> to keep its promise to free the men.<br>"The regime has said it would release men after they had been screened, and we expect them to keep that pledge," spokesman Edgar <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02qfmk_">Vasquez</a> said.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02w8c_">Given</a>n the regime's past actions, the international community cannot take this for granted and needs to monitor the fate of these men."<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02qfmk_">Vasquez</a> said any attempt to keep them in detention "will not go unnoticed".<br>"The regime should know that the world is watching with deep concern what is taking place in <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0k9qf">Homs</a> and the status of these male evacuees."<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/07ssc">British</a> Foreign Secretary William Hague called the detentions "outrageous".<br>A humanitarian operation began last Friday in ravaged <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0k9qf">Homs</a>, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06vbd">Syria's</a> third city, where regime forces have besieged rebel-held districts for more than 600 days.<br>- Siege conditions 'dismal' -<br>Activists say living conditions under the siege are dismal, with some 3,000 people surviving on little more than olives and herbs.<br>The United Nations says 336 men aged between 16 and 54 have left the besieged districts since Friday, although a UN-mediated deal had only envisaged the evacuation of women, children and the elderly.<br>Men fleeing the siege cited "hunger" as their reason for leaving.<br>The <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0k9qf">Homs</a> operation has so far seen some 1,400 people evacuated and 6.2 tons of flour and 500 food parcels distributed.<br>Although no evacuations or aid deliveries were expected Thursday, Barazi said the truce will probably be extended for another three days from Friday.<br>Meanwhile, a spike in regime air attacks and fighting has sent the death toll soaring, as <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02l9kb">Brahimi</a> struggles to prevent the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03902">Geneva</a> talks from collapsing.<br>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported at least 51 people killed on Wednesday in Aleppo alone, mostly civilians in air raids.<br>The Britain-based watchdog has reported an average of 236 people killed daily since the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03902">Geneva</a> II process began on January 22.<br>It said explosive-packed barrel bombs were responsible for many of Wednesday's <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01505k">Aleppo</a> fatalities.<br>They killed 28 people, including seven children, in opposition areas of what was once <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06vbd">Syria's</a> commercial capital.<br>Rights groups have repeatedly condemned the regime's use of helicopter-borne barrel bombs as "indiscriminate".<br>In <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01x38c">Daraa</a> in the south, 31 people were killed on Wednesday, again mostly in barrel bomb attacks, the Observatory said.<br>- Highest daily death tolls -<br>Around 20 air strikes on <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02qfsd4">Yabrud</a> and nearby fighting pushed some 400 families to flee to <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0n4bhdh">Arsal</a> in neighbouring <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04hqz">Lebanon</a>, the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/07t65">UN</a> refugee agency's <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0bwmvf">Dana</a> <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0fgcyk">Sleiman</a> said via <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0289n8t">Twitter</a>.<br>The latest daily death tolls in <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06vbd">Syria</a>, including dozens killed in fighting between Islamists and mainstream rebels,  have been the highest since the war began and coincide with the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03902">Geneva</a> talks.<br>According to the Observatory, some 5,000 people have died in just three weeks -- an average of 236 people a day.<br>The monitor says a total of at least 136,000 people have been killed since the conflict erupted in March 2011.<br>In <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03902">Geneva</a>, the opposition <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01gq7c">National Coalition</a> has laid out a transition plan, including evicting foreign fighters and a process towards elections.<br>But the government refused to discuss it, saying the first item on the agenda had to be the battle against what it calls rebel "terrorism".<br></p></body></html>

Firstly, because <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0dsttr">Madeleine</a> is not a successor to the throne," said Roger Lundgren, the editor of Kungliga Magasinet, a <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0d0vqn">Swedish</a> magazine about royalty. "Secondly, this is a private wedding, the king is paying for it himself," he said.<br>Still, thousands of people are expected to line the streets of central <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06mxs">Stockholm</a> to catch a glimpse of the newlyweds before they travel by boat from the island of <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01vr4r">Riddarholmen</a> to a wedding banquet at <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0nrcl">Drottningholm</a><br>Palace, where <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/028pdt">Princess Madeleine</a> was born in 1982.<br>The <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0d0vqn">Swedish</a> capital will provide a picturesque backdrop with its 14 main islands and a <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01522">Baltic Sea</a> archipelago of some 24,000 islands.<br>From nearby <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01hgry">Skeppsholmen</a>, a 21-gun salute will be fired after the wedding. "You will definitely notice that there's a royal wedding underway in <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06mxs">Stockholm</a>," <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02v406">Lundgren</a> said.<br>Around 600 guests, including Crown Prince Fredrik of Denmark, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0p6pl">Crown Prince Haakon</a> of Norway and Princess Charlene of Monaco, have been invited to witness the exchange of vows. From <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03_3d">Japan</a>, Princess Takamado will be<br>attending, while <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/07ssc">Britain</a> is sending <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0xm_0">Prince Edward</a>, Earl of Wessex.<br>Unlike Victoria, who is widely respected and admired for her easy-going and down-to-earth style, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0dsttr">Madeleine</a> has had a complicated relationship with the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0d0vqn">Swedish</a> public.<br>In her early twenties, the tabloids dubbed her "the party princess" after she was photographed in nightclubs around <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06mxs">Stockholm's</a> trendy <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0bp86p">Stureplan</a> square.<br>The photogenic royal became a paparazzi favourite but felt uncomfortable speaking with journalists, which may have given people the wrong impression of her, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02v406">Lundgren</a> said.<br>"Because she (rarely) gives interviews, we don't know her," he said. "I think she's been punished by the media because she looks so good. The media like to put labels on her, and they're not always accurate," he added.<br>The perception of <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0dsttr">Madeleine</a> as a carefree party girl became so widespread even ardent royalists began to worry.<br>Catarina Hurtig, a royal reporter and author, said readers would call her and ask her to tell the king to give <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0dsttr">Madeleine</a> "a dressing down".<br>"A lot of people asked who was paying for all the parties, and it emerged that she and here friends were often being treated by the club owners" who would contact the tabloids, she said.<br>In April 2010, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0dsttr">Madeleine</a> moved to <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02_286">New York</a> after a broken engagement to a <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/06mxs">Stockholm</a> lawyer.<br>Although her <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/015pgg">Madison Avenue</a> shopping sprees have continued to draw controversy in her homeland, so much that the royal court felt compelled to announce tax payers were not footing the bill, she has also earned respect from <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0d0vqn">Swedes</a> for her work as an unpaid employee of the Childhood foundation.<br>"Those children have no idea what <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0d0vqn">Sweden</a> is, but they definitely know what a princess is. And she's very good at being that fairytale princess when she meets them," <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02v406">Lundgren</a> said.<br> <br><br></p></body></html>

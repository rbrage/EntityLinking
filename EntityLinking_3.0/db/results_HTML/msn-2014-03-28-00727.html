Those few who planned the attack on the USS Cole in <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01z88t">Yemen</a> 10 years ago and the atrocities in <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09c7w0">America</a> on September 11, 2001, were killed or captured by the spring of 2003, and <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05mg9">Osama</a> bin <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05mg9">Laden</a> has been hard pressed ever since to recruit anyone able to take their place. But now, at last, he seems to have found his man, and that's a major reason intelligence services from <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0rh6k">Washington</a> to <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05qtj">Paris</a> to <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0dhd5">Islamabad</a> have been acting so jittery of late.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/07sc5xs">Ilyas Kashmiri</a>, 46, has the experience, the connections, and a determination to attack the West'including the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/07y2s">United</a> States'that make him the most dangerous <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0v74">Qaeda</a> operative to emerge in years. "This guy ties everybody together," says a veteran <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09c7w0">U.S.</a> intelligence officer who has been watching Kashmiri's rise to prominence closely but is not authorized to speak publicly. Kashmiri fought the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05vz3zq">Soviets</a> in <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0jdd">Afghanistan</a>, and the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03rk0">Indians</a> in <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/010vz">Kashmir</a> and in <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03rk0">India</a> itself. He also worked with the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05sb1">Pakistani</a> intelligence service, but turned on <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0dhd5">Islamabad</a> with a vengeance in 2003, trying to murder then-president <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/061s_">Pervez Musharraf</a>. Since then Kashmiri has been linked to planned attacks in <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0k6nt">Denmark</a>, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0345h">Germany</a>, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0f8l9c">France</a>, the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/07ssc">United Kingdom</a>, and the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09c7w0">United States</a>, most probably <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01_d4">Chicago</a>.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01h1bf">Today</a>, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05sb1">Pakistani</a> intelligence assets on the ground and <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09c7w0">American</a> drones in the air hunt Kashmiri relentlessly in the ungoverned tribal areas near <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05sb1">Pakistan's</a> border with <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0jdd">Afghanistan</a>. <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05sb1">Pakistani</a> officials fear that if Kashmiri carries out another major attack on <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/03rk0">India</a> or in the West, their country could suffer massive retaliation. A senior <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05sb1">Pakistani</a> military officer who tracks militants, and declines to be named for security reasons, says Kashmiri's "skill, his leadership, and his wide relations with <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05sb1">Pakistani</a> and foreign militants make him the most dangerous man for <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05sb1">Pakistan</a>, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/02j9z">Europe</a>, and the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09c7w0">U.S."</a> Kashmiri agrees. After erroneous reports that he'd been killed in September 2009, he gave an interview and gloated that the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/09c7w0">Americans</a> were right to pursue him. "They know their enemy well," he said. "They know what I am really up to."<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0gr9_">Born</a> in the Pakistani-controlled section of <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/010vz">Kashmir</a> in 1964, this veteran terrorist lost an index finger and one of his eyes during the fight against the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/05vz3zq">Soviets</a> in the 1980s. In such photographs as exist, he's often shown wearing aviator sunglasses. He reportedly changes the color of his thick beard frequently, and it may be white or dyed red with henna, or then again dyed black. But his imposing presence and the deference shown him can still make him stand out.<br>To read the rest of this article on Newsweek.com, click here.<br>Follow <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01fcfs">Newsweek</a> on <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0289n8t">Twitter</a>.<br>More Articles on Newsweek: Why the Midterms Matter A Pyrrhic Victory in <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0f8l9c">France</a> <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0jl0g">Merkel</a> <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04zxsxj">Nails</a> the Foreign Question Going After Graft<br></p></body></html>

A general rule of thumb is the more detail in the signal then the longer it takes to decode, thereby causing a short delay.<br>For this reason, viewers watching via an analogue signal - or with their aerial lead plugged directly from the television into the wall as has been the way for decades - will most likely receive their signal first. Their 'live' broadcast is likely to suffer a delay of a second or less.<br>This is why those watching on older, analogue <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01p6qb">TVs</a> will most likely be a few seconds ahead of their high-definition counterparts.<br>Almost live: Coding delays in your television set and at the broadcaster's end are the most common cause<br>Those watching on hi-def televisions, however, will most likely be<br>watching events last due to the extra time spent decoding their high<br>quality signal.<br>However it's at the broadcaster's end where the delays really build up.<br>Each company has its own method of encoding digital signals and these take various lengths of time, although most within a couple of seconds of each other.<br>Likewise, it also makes a difference whether you're receiving your signal through<br>Sky, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/0n85g">Virgin</a>, <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04vnvv">Tiscali</a> or any other of the <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/07ssc">UK's</a> numerous digital<br>providers.<br>Each provider again has individual ways of decoding a broadcaster's digital signal, some taking longer than others.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/04fqd0">Jos</a> <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01qwfk">Hirst</a>, a lecturer in audio technology at <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01lrh5">Salford University</a> in<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/052bw">Manchester</a>, said: 'A digital signal needs to be decoded on whatever<br>equipment you're watching it on.<br>'Decoding on your television can make a small difference, but it's at<br>the broadcaster's end where delays are most likely to take place.'<br>By the same token those watching sports events online also have to contend with possible tiny delays while a signal travels through an IP network.<br>With so many options to watch television now available, where you stand in the hierarchy of receiving live broadcasts is difficult to pinpoint.<br>But, as a guide, the more high quality the broadcast, the longer the broadcast delay.<br></p></body></html>

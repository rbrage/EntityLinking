It did not go into reverse and I do not know if it has a reverse unit.  My knowledge of the early prewar pieces is somewhat limited.  The cowcatcher is broken off the front of the engine. It also has some rust on the cab as you can see in my pictures.  There is also a grab iron missing off the rear of the engine and the screws that hold the boiler front on are missing.  The tender is missing the coal pile but I think replacement coal piles are available.<br>I took lots of pictures and close-ups so please see the pictures for a better description.<br>Shipping is by priority mail and I think $11 will cover it.  I will cover an amount over $11 and will refund any overage greater than $1.  I also gladly combine shipping if you purchase more than item.<br><a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/08v56f">Thanks</a> and email me with questions.  I normally ship within 48 hours after receiving payment.<br>, this auction is almost over and you're currently the high bidder.<br>Please enter a valid number as the bid price.<br>Enter an amount that is equal or greater than the minimum bid required.

In all my past videos and photo shoots I've starved myself for days to get into what I felt was a good enough shape. But in this one, I was wearing leggings!<br>''And a skin-tight T-shirt and a bra over the top - you can see the bulge! It wasn't necessarily pretty, but I felt very strongly that I wanted to do that. Because I'm a woman now, and I have two babies, and I don't want to hide it.''<br>Lily refuses to confirm to the perception of what a pop star should be or what a woman should look like and won't compromise spending time with her children for the sake of a toned stomach.<br>The 28-year-old singer explained: ''I could be skinny if I wanted to, by exercising a lot, and I just don't have the time right now. Every second I'm not working I'm spending with my children. For me to take another extra hour and a half out of my day to get thin, I'm not doing it.<br>''Without being the 'I love my body, because my body gave me my children' cliché. It's hard. It's hard to go back to being a pop star. <a href="https://www.freebase.com/m/01mpq7s">Beyoncé</a> touches upon it in 'Pretty Hurts', on her new album. It's difficult to keep up and try to be perfect.''<br></p></body></html>
